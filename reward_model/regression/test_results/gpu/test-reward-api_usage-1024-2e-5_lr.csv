0,"I'm using Imageio, the python library that wraps around ffmpeg to do hardware encoding via nvenc. My issue is that I can't get more than 2 sessions to launch (I am using non-quadro GPUs). Even using multiple GPUs. I looked over NVIDIA's support matrix and they state only 2 sessions per gpu, but it seems to be per system.
For example I have 2 GPUs in a system. I can either use the env variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES or set the ffmpeg flag -gpu to select the GPU. I've verified gpu usage using Nvidia-smi cli.

Determines if the input array is prefiltered with spline_filter before interpolation

I'm working with Python in Jupyter Notebook and am trying to create my own module with some selfmade functions/loops that I often use. However, when I try to some of the functions from my module, I get an error related to the import of the built-in module that is used in my own module.
The way I created my own module was by:

creating different blocks of code in a notebook and downloading it
as  'Functions.py' file.
saving this Functions.py file in the folder that i'm currently working in (with another notebook file)
in my current notebook file (where i'm doing my analysis), I import my module with 'import Functions'.

So far, the import of my own module seems to work. However, some of my self-made functions use functions from built-in modules. E.g. my plot_lines() function uses math.ceil() somewhere in the code. Therefore, I imported 'math' in my analysis notebook as well. But when I try to run the function plot_lines() in my notebook, I get the error ""NameError: name 'math' is not defined"".
I tried to solve this error by adding the code 'import math' to the function in my module as well, but this did not resolve the issue. 
So my question is: how can I use functions from built-in Python modules in my own modules?
Thanks so much in advance for any help!","If anyone encounters the same issue:

I was thinking of somehow receiving the user input on a simple web page with two text boxes to input their Instagram account info (username & pass).

I don't have control over the speed of the belt.
Now, the challenge is that I have to configure a ton of things to make the machine work properly.
The first problem is the time model takes to create segmentation masks, it varies from one object to another.
Another issue is how do I maintain signals that are generated after computer vision processing, send them to actuators in a manner that it won't get misaligned with the computer vision-based inferencing.
My initial design includes creating processes responsible for a specific task and then make them communicate with one other as per the necessity. However, the problem of synchronization still persists.
As of now, I am thinking of treating the software stack as a group of services as we usually do in backend and make them communicate using something like celery and Redis queue.

What you want to do

The ""object"" is on the conveyer belt
The camera will take pictures of the object
MaskRCNN will run to do the analyzing

Here are some problems you're facing

""The first problem is the time model takes to create segmentation masks, it varies from one object to another.""   

-> if you want to reduce the processing time for each image, then an accelerator (FPGA, Chip, etc) or some acceleration technique is needed. Intel OpenVino and Intel DL stick is a good start. 
-> if there are too many pictures to process then you'll have 2 choices: 1) put a lot of machines so all the job can be done or 2) select only the important job and discard others. The fact that you set the ""Maximum Accutuation"" to a fixed number (3/sec) made me think that this is the problem you're facing. A background subtractor is a good start for creating images capture triggers. 

""Another issue is how do I maintain signals that are generated after computer vision processing, send them to actuators in a manner that it won't get misaligned with the computer vision-based inferencing.""

-> a ""job distributor"" like Celery is good choice here. If the message is stacked inside the broker (Redis), then some tasks will have to wait. But this can easily by scaling up your computer.

The way I would go about doing this would be to wrap the following in an ssh session:
for f in $(files); do stat $f > /dev/null ;done
The stdout redirect will ignore all good files and then reading the stderr will give me a list of all non found files.
I first thought of using this bash code with the ssh part inside a subprocess.run(..., shell=True) but was discouraged to do so. Instead,paramikowas suggested. 
I try to understand why and when native python is better than subprocessing bash

Computability with different OS (not an issue for me as the code is pretty tightly tied to Ubuntu)
Error and exception handling - this one I do get and think it's important, though catching an exception or exit code from subprocess is kinda easy too

The con in my eyes with native python is the need to involve somewhat complicated modules such as paramiko when bash's ssh and stat seem to me as more plain and easy to use
Are there any guidelines for when and how to choose bash over python?
This question is mainly about using a command over ssh, but is relevant for any other command that bash is doing in a short and easy way and python wraps","There are really three choices here: doing something in-process (like paramiko), running ssh directly (with subprocess), and running ssh with the shell (also with subprocess).  As a general rule, avoid running the shell programmatically (as opposed to, say, upon interactive user request).
The reason is that it’s a human-oriented interface (thus the easy separation of words with spaces and shortcuts for $HOME and globbing) that is vastly underpowered as an API.  Consider, for example, how your code would detect that ssh was missing: the situation doesn’t arise with paramiko (so long as it is installed), is obvious with subprocess, and is just an (ambiguous) exit code and stderr message from the shell.  Also consider how you supply the command to run: it already must be a command suitable for the shell (due to limitations in the SSH protocol), but if you invoke ssh with the shell it must be encoded (sometimes called “doubly escaped”) so as to have the local shell’s interpretation be the desired multi-word command for the remote shell.
So far, paramiko and subprocess are pretty much equivalent.  As a more difficult case, consider how a key verification failure would manifest: paramiko would describe the failure as data, whereas the others would attempt to interact with the user (which might or might not be present).  paramiko also supports opening multiple channels over one authenticated connection; ssh does so as well but only via a complicated ControlMaster configuration involving Unix socket files (which might not have any good place to exist in some deployments).  Speaking of configuration, you may need to pass -F to avoid complications from the user’s .ssh/config if it is not designed with this automated use case in mind.
In summary, libraries are designed for use cases like yours, and so it should be no surprise that they work better, especially for edge cases, than assembling your own interface from human-oriented commands (although it is very useful that such manual compositions are possible!).  If installing a non-standard dependency like paramiko is a burden, at least use subprocess directly; cutting out the second shell is already a great improvement.",0.4082,0.39361927,0.0002115282259183,0.014580729999999986,464,289

77,"I'm using Tensorflow 1.14 and the tf.keras API to build a number (>10) of differnet neural networks. (I'm also interested in the answers to this question using Tensorflow 2). I'm wondering how I should organize my project.
I convert the keras models into estimators using tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator and Tensorboard for visualization. I'm also sometimes using model.summary(). Each of my models has a number (>20) of hyperparameters and takes as input one of three types of input data. I sometimes use hyperparameter optimization, such that I often manually delete models and use tf.keras.backend.clear_session() before trying the next set of hyperparameters. 
Currently I'm using functions that take hyperparameters as arguments and return the respective compiled keras model to be turned into an estimator. I use three different ""Main_Datatype.py"" scripts to train models for the three different input data types. All data is loaded from .tfrecord files and there is an input function for each data type, which is used by all estimators taking that type of data as input. I switch between models (i.e. functions returning a model) in the Main scripts. I also have some building blocks that are part of more than one model, for which I use helper functions returning them, piecing together the final result using the Keras functional API.
The slight incompatibilities of the different models are begining to confuse me and I've decided to organise the project using classes. I'm planing to make a class for each model that keeps track of hyperparameters and correct naming of each model and its model directory. However, I'm wondering if there are established or recomended ways to do this in Tensorflow.
Question: Should I be subclassing tf.keras.Model instead of using functions to build models or python classes that encapsulate them? Would subclassing keras.Model break (or require much work to enable) any of the functionality that I use with keras estimators and tensorboard? I've seen many issues people have with using custom Model classes and am somewhat reluctant to put in the work only to find that it doesn't work for me.

lambda n: - defines a function that takes 1 argument (n); equivalent to an anonymous version of: def somefunc(n):
reduce() - we'll come back to what it does later; as per docs, this is a function that operates on another function, an iterable, and optionally some initial value, in that order. These are:

A) lambda x, _: - again, defines a function. This time, it's a function of two arguments, and the underscore as the identifier is just a convention to signal we're not gonna use it.
B) X + [ <stuff> ] - prepend some list of stuff with the value of the first arg. We already know from the fact we're using reduce that the arg is some list.
C) The <stuff> is x[-1] + x[-2] - meaning the list we're prepending our X to is, in this case, the sum of the last two items already in X, before we do anything to X in this iteration.
range(n-2) is the iterable we're working on; so, a list of numbers from 1 to N-2. The -2 is here because the initial value (in 3) already has the first two numbers covered.
Speaking of which, [0, 1] is our predefined first two starting values for X[-2], X[-1].

40,"I'm making a game with Pygame, and now I stuck on how to process collision between player and wall. This is 2D RPG with cells, where some of them are walls. You look on world from top, like in Pacman.
So, I know that i can get list of collisions by pygame.spritecollide() and it will return me list of objects that player collides. I can get ""collide rectangle"" by player.rect.clip(wall.rect), but how I can get player back from the wall?
So, I had many ideas. The first was push player back in opposite direction, but if player goes, as example, both right and bottom directions and collide with vertical wall right of itself, player stucks, because it is needed to push only left, but not up.
The second idea was implement diagonally moving like one left and one bottom. But in this way we don't now, how move first: left or bottom, and order becomes the most important factor.
So, I don't know what algorithm I should use.","If you know the location of the centre of the cell and the location of the player you can calculate the x distance and the y distance from the wall at that point in time. Would it be possible at that point to take the absolute value of each distance and then take the largest value as the direction to push the player in.
e.g. The player collides with the right of the wall so the distance from the centre of the wall in the y direction should be less than the distance in x.
Therefore you know that the player collided with the left or the right of the wall and not the top, this means the push should be to the right or the left.
If the player's movement is stored as in the form [x, y] then knowing whether to push left or right isn't important since flipping the direction of movement in the x axis gives the correct result.
The push should therefore be in the x direction in this example
e.g. player.vel_x = -player.vel_x.
This would leave the movement in the y axis unchanged so hopefully wouldn't result in the problem you mentioned.

63,"I am solving a system of non-linear equations using the Newton Raphson Method in Python. This involves using the solve(Ax,b) function (spsolve in my case, which is for sparse matrices) iteratively until the error or update reduces below a certain threshold. My specific problem involves calculating functions such as x/(e^x - 1) , which are badly calculated for small x by Python, even using np.expm1().
Despite these difficulties, it seems like my solution converges, because the error becomes of the order of 10^-16. However, the dependent quantities, do not behave physically, and I suspect this is due to the precision of these calculations. For example, I am trying to calculate the current due to a small potential difference. When this potential difference becomes really small, this current begins to oscillate, which is wrong, because currents must be conserved.
I would like to globally increase the precision of my code, but I'm not sure if that's a useful thing to do since I am not sure whether this increased precision would be reflected in functions such as spsolve.

With 2 threads reading you will get at best 1/2 the speed per thread (in practice even less), with 3 threads - 1/3 the speed, etc.

For that reason you should prefer to read from disk sequentially from only one thread at a time. Reading the file in 2 threads in parallel will not only reduce the speed of each read by half, but will further reduce because of non-sequential (interleaved) disk access.

The setup that you need is a backend server that is running python (flask is a good framework for that) that will do some processing depending on the request that is being sent to it. It will then send some data to a template processor (jinja in this case work well with flask). This will in turn put the data right into the html page you want to generate. Then this html page will be returned to the client making the request, which is something the browser will understand and will show to the user. If you want to do some computation dynamically on the browser you will need to use javascript instead which is something a browser can run (since its in a sandbox mode).

26,"I’m way new to ML so I have a really rudimentary question. I would appreciate it if one clarifies it for me.
Suppose I have a set of tweets which labeled as negative and positive. I want to perform some sentiment analysis. 
I extracted 3 basic features: 

Emotion icons 
Exclamation marks 
Intensity words(very, really etc.). 

How should I use these features with SVM or other ML algorithms? 
In other words, how should I deploy the extracted features in SVM algorithm?
I'm working with python and already know how should I run SVM or other algorithms, but I don't have any idea about the relation between extracted features and role of them in each algorithm!
Based on the responses of some experts I update my question:
At first, I wanna appreciate your time and worthy explanations. I think my problem is solving… So in line with what you said, each ML algorithm may need some vectorized features and I should find a way to represent my features as vectors. I want to explain what I got from your explanation via a rudimentary example.
Say I have emoticon icons (for example 3 icons) as one feature:
1-Hence, I should represent this feature by a vector with 3 values. 
2-The vectorized feature can initial in this way : [0,0,0] (each value represents an icon = :) and :( and :P ). 
3-Next I should go through each tweet and check whether the tweet has an icon or not. For example [2,1,0] shows that the tweet has: :) 2 times, and :( 1 time, and :p no time.
4-After I check all the tweets I will have a big vector with the size of n*3 (n is the total number of my tweets). 
5-Stages 1-4 should be done for other features.
6-Then I should merge all those features by using m models of SVM (m is the number of my features) and then classify by majority vote or some other method.
Or should create a long vector by concatenating all of the vectors, and feed it to the SVM.
Could you please correct me if there is any misunderstanding? If it is not correct I will delete it otherwise I should let it stay cause It can be practical for any beginners such as me...
Thanks a bunch…","basically, to make things very ""simple"" and ""shallow"", all algorithm takes some sort of a numeric vector represent the features
the real work is to find how to represent the features as vector which yield the best result, this depends by the feature itself and on the algorithm using
for example to use SVM which basically find a separator plane, you need to project the features on some vectors set which yield a good enough separation, so for instance you can treat your features like this:

Emotion icons - create a vector which represent all the icons present in that tweet, define each icon to an index from 1 to n so tweet represented by [0,0,0,2,1] means the 4th and 5th icons are appearing in his body 2 and 1 times respectively
Exclamation marks - you can simply count the number of occurrences (a better approach will be to represent some more information about it like the place in a sentence and such...)
Intensity words - you can use the same approach as the Emotion icons

basically each feature can be used alone in the SVM model to classify good and bad
you can merge all those features by using 3 models of SVM and then classify by majority vote or some other method
or
you can create a long vector by concatenating all of the vectors, and feed it to the SVM

this is just a one approach, you might tweak it or use some other one to fit your data, model and goal better",1.0,0.19756514,0.6439017057418823,0.80243486,310,510

On Windows 10 I have to install the CP210x driver and manually attach it to the device (otherwise Windows tries to find the device manufacturer's driver - it's a CP210x serial chip), and in Linux write the vendorID and productID to the cp210x driver to allow it to attach to ttyUSB0. This works fine.  
The Windows driver is from SiliconLabs - the manufacturer of the UART-USB chip in the device.
So on Windows it is attached to COM5 and Linux to ttyUSB0 (Ubuntu, Raspbian)
Using Wireshark I can snoop the usb bus successfully on both operating systems.
The USB device sends data regularly over the USB bus and on Windows using Wireshark I can see this communication as ""URB_INTERRUPT in"" messages with the final few bytes actually containing the data I require.
On Linux it seems that the device connects but using Wireshark this time I can only see URB_BULK packets. Examining the endpoints using pyusb I see that there is no URB_Interrupt endpoint only the URB_Bulk.
Using the pyusb libraries on Linux it appears that the only endpoints available are URB_BULK.
Question mainly is how do I tell Linux to get the device to send via the Interrupt transfer mechanism as Windows seems to do.  I don't see a method in pyusb's set_configuration to do this (as no Interrupt transfer endpoints appear) and haven't found anything in the manufacturer's specification.

Solution: First off this is a warning, and not an outright error, so it won't necessarily break your program. So depending on your exact use case, you may be able to ignore it for now.
That being said, there are a few options you can consider:

Option 1: Change the code yourself -- Go into the pandas_datareader module and modify the line of code in compat_init.py that currently says from pandas.util.testing import assert_frame_equal simply to from pandas.testing import assert_frame_equal. This will import the same function from the correct module.
Option 2: Wait for pandas-datareader to update --You can also wait for the library to be upgraded to import correctly and then run pip3 install --upgrade pandas-datareader. You can go to the Github repo for pandas-datareader and raise an issue.
Option 3: Ignore it -- Just ignore the warning for now since it doesn't break your program.",0.0,0.33053726,0.1092548817396164,0.33053726,270,79

The client is an ARM debian based machine and the server is a windows box. Port 1433 is closed on the MSSQL box but port 32001 is open and pymssql is still able to remotely connect to the server as it somehow falls back to using the named pipe port (32001).

76,"I have been told it is 'bad practice' to return data from a Django view and use those returned items in Javascript that is loaded on the page.
For example: if I was writing an app that needed some extra data to load/display a javascript based graph, I was told it's wrong to pass that data directly into the javascript on the page from a template variable passed from the Django view.
My first thought: 

Just get the data the graph needs in the django view and return it in a context variable to be used in the template. Then just reference that context variable directly in the javascript in the template. 

It should load the data fine - but I was told that is the wrong way.
So how is it best achieved?
My second thought: 

Spin up Django Rest Framework and create an endpoint where you pass any required data to and make an AJAX request when the page loads - then load the data and do the JS stuff needed. 

This works, except for one thing, how do I get the variables required for the AJAX request into the AJAX request itself? 
I'd have to get them either from the context (which is the 'wrong way') or get the parameters from the URL. Is there any easy way to parse the data out of the URL in JS? It seems like a pain in the neck just to get around not utilizing the view for the data needed and accessing those variables directly in the JS.
So, is it really 'bad practice' to pass data from the Django view and use it directly in the Javascript? 
Are both methods acceptable?
What is the Django appropriate way to get data like that into the Javascript on a given page/template?","Passing data directly is not always the wrong way to go. JS is there so you can execute code when everything else is ready. So when they tell you it's the wrong way to pass data directly, it's because there is no point in making the page and data heavier than it should be before JS kicks in. 
BUT it's okay to pass the essential data so your JS codes knows what it has to do. To make it more clear, let's look into your case:
You want to render a graph. And graphs are sometimes heavy to render and it can make the first render slow. And most of the time, graphs are not so useful without the extra context that your page provides. So in order to make your web page load faster, you let JS load your graph after your webpage has been rendered. And if you're going to wait, then there is no point in passing the extra data needed because it makes the page heavier and slows down the initial render and it takes time to parse and convert those data to JSON objects. 
By removing the data and letting JS load them in the background, you make your page smaller and faster to render. So while a user is reading the context needed for your graph, JS will fetch the data needed and renders the graph. This will cause your web page to have a faster initial render.
So in general:
When to pass data directly:

When the initial data is necessary for JS to do what it has to (configs, defaults, etc).
When the time difference matters a lot and you can't wait too much for an extra request to complete the render.
When data is very small.

When not to pass data directly:

When rendering the extra data takes time anyway, so why not get the data latter too?
When the data size is big.
When you need to render something as fast as possible.
When there are some heavy processes needed for those data.
When JS can make your data size smaller (Decide what kind of data should be passed exactly using options that are only accessible by JS.)",0.8163,0.39717108,0.1756913214921951,0.41912892,432,362

The threading module creates threads within the same Python process and switches between them, this means they're not really running at the same time. The same happens with the Asyncio module, however this has the additional feature of setting when a thread can be switched. 
Then there is the multiprocessing module which creates a separate Python process per thread. This means that the threads will not have access to shared memory but can mean that the processes run on different CPU cores and therefore can provide a performance improvement for CPU bound tasks. 
Regarding when to use new threads a good rule of thumb would be:

For I/O bound problems, use threading or async I/O. This is because you're waiting on responses from something external, like a database or browser, and this waiting time can instead be filled by another thread running it's task. 
For CPU bound problems use multiprocessing. This can run multiple Python processes on separate cores at the same time.

If you have a high training accuracy and a low validation accuracy, you are indeed overfitting. If you have several convolution layers, you may want to apply BN after each.

Now you can walk/recurse/pop your way through both lists in a single pass, building a new list of {start, height} outputs as you go. I see no reason you couldn't be building both your union and intersection lists at the same time.

Polling - With this method, you would periodically send a request to the server (maybe every 5 seconds for example) and ask for an update. The upside is that it is easy to implement. The downside is that many requests will be unnecessary. It sounds like this isn't a great option for you. 
Long Polling - This method means you would open a request up with the server and leave the request open for a long period of time. When the server gets new information it will send a response and close the request - after which the client will immediately open up a new ""long poll"" request. This eliminates some of the unnecessary requests with regular polling, but it is a bit of a hack as HTTP was meant for a reasonably short request response cycle. Some PaaS providers only allow a 30 second window for this to occur for example. 
Web Sockets - This is somewhat harder to setup, but ultimately is the best solution for real time server to client (and vice versa) communication.

Also, the computation takes a few seconds, so I suppose I need some type of task queue to not make the server hang in the meanwhile. Tell me if I'm wrong.
It's a bit of a general question because I myself don't know the specifics of what I need to use to accomplish this. I'm using Flask in the backend but it's a framework-agnostic question.","Save the image to a file. Return a webpage that contains an <IMG SRC=...> element. The SRC should be a URL pointing at the file.
For example, suppose you save the image to a file called ""temp2.png"" in a subdirectory called ""scratch"" under your document root. Then the IMG element would be <IMG SRC=""/scratch/temp2.png""> .
If you create and save the image in the same program that generates the webpage that refers to it, your server won't return the page until the image has been saved. If that only takes a few seconds, the server is unlikely to hang. Many applications would take that long to calculate a result, so the people who coded the server would make sure it can handle such delays. I've done this under Apache, Tomcat, and GoServe (an OS/2 server), and never had a problem.
This method does have the disadvantage that you'll need to arrange for each temporary file to be deleted after an expiry period such as 12 hours or whenever you think the user won't need it any more. On the webpage you return, if the image is something serious that the user might want to keep, you could warn them that this will happen. They can always download it.
To delete the old files, write a script that checks when they were last updated, compares that with the current date and time, and deletes those files that are older than your expiry period. 
You'll need a way to automatically run it repeatedly. On Unix systems, if you have shell access, the ""cron"" command is one way to do this. Googling ""cron job to delete files older than 1 hour on web server"" finds a lot of discussion of methods.
Be very careful when coding any automatic-deletion script, and test it thoroughly to make sure it deletes the right files! If you make your expiry period a variable, you can set it to e.g. 1 minute or 5 minutes when testing, so that you don't need to wait for ages.

As I am not experienced with creating websites, I have no idea what the most reasonable setup for this website would be. 

Would it be reasonable for this example to choose a database where every row corresponds of 9 fields, where the first column is the timestamp (lets say data for every minute), the next four columns correspond  to the high, low, open, close price of DAX for this timestamp and columns 5 to 9 correspond to high, low, open, close price for DOW JONES?

As a total beginner with webhosting (is this even the right term?) it is very hard for me to ask precise questions.

I was thinking about amazon web services.","You could use a database, but that doesn't seem necessary for what you described.
It would be reasonable to build the database as you described.  Look into SQL for doing so.  You can download a package XAMPP that will give you pretty much everything you need for that.  This is easily scalable to hundreds of thousands of entries - that's what databases are for.
If your example of stock prices is actually what you are trying to show, however, this is completely unnecessary as there are already plenty of databases that have this data and will allow you to query them.  What you would really want in this scenario is an API.  Alpha Vantage is a free service that will serve you data on stock prices, and has plenty of documentation to help you get it set up with python.

to computing and don't know how to request an improvement of a

As the code next(iter(())) raises StopIteration, I expected to

So it appears the unpacking of the map object stopped when
StopIteration came from next hitting the ""empty"" iterator

handled right, as StopIteration was not raised before the ""empty""
iterator was picked from the list (to be hit by next).

Did I understand the behaviour correctly?
Is this behaviour somehow intended?
Will this be changed in a near future?  Or how can I get it?

Edit: The behaviour is similar if I unpack the map object in different ways, such as by list, for for-loop, unpacking within a list, unpacking for function arguments, by set, dict.  So I believe it's not tuple but map that's wrong.
Edit: Actually, in Python 2 (2.7.10), the ""same"" code raises
StopIteration.  I think this is the desirable result (except that map in this case does not return an iterator).","Did I understand the behavior correctly?


Not quite. map takes its first argument, a function, and applies it to every item in some iterable, its second argument, until it catches the StopIteration exception.

79,"let us say I have a python 3.7+ module/script A which does extensive computations.

Would a getter in module A make sense so that module B has to always call this getter (maybe in a loop) in order to retrieve the progress of A?
Would it possible to somehow use a callback function which is implemented in module A in such a way that this function is called every time the progress updates? So that this callback returns the current progress of A.

83,"It's past time for me to move from my custom scientific workflow management (python) to some group effort.  In brief, my workflow involves long running (days) processes with a large number of shared parameters.  As a dependency graph, nodes are tasks that produce output or do some other work. That seems fairly universal in workflow tools.
However, key to my needs is that each task is defined by the parameters it requires.   Tasks are instantiated with respect to the state of those parameters and all parameters of its dependencies.  Thus if a task has completed its job according to a given parameter state, it is complete and not rerun.  This parameter state is NOT the global parameter state but only what is relevant to that part of the DAG. This reliance on parameter state rather than time completed appears to be the essential difference between my needs and existing tools (at least what I have gathered from a quick look at Luigi and Airflow).  Time completed might be one such parameter, but in general it is not the time that determines a (re)run of the DAG, but whether the parameter state is congruent with the parameter state of the calling task. There are non-trivial issues (to me) with 'parameter explosion' and the relationship to parameter state and the DAG, but those are not my question here.
My question -- which existing python tool would more readily allow defining 'complete' with respect to this parameter state?  It's been suggested that Luigi is compatible with my needs by writing a custom complete method that would compare the metadata of built data ('targets') with the needed parameter state.
How about Airflow? I don't see any mention of this issue but have only briefly perused the docs.  Since adding this functionality is a significant effort that takes away from my 'scientific' work, I would like to start out with the better tool. Airflow definitely has momentum but my needs may be too far from its purpose.
Defining the complete parameter state is needed for two reasons -- 1) with complex, long running tasks, I can't just re-run the DAG every time I change some parameter in the very large global parameter state, and 2) I need to know how the intermediate and final results have been produced for scientific and data integrity reasons.","I looked further into Luigi and Airflow and as far as I could discern neither of these is suitable for modification for my needs.  The primary incompatibility is that these tools are fundamentally based on predetermined DAGs/workflows.  My existing framework operates on instantiated and fully specified DAGs that are discovered at run-time rather than concisely described externally -- necessary because knowing whether each task is complete, for a given request, is dependent on many combinations of parameter values that define the output of that task and the utilized output of all upstream tasks. By instantiated, I mean the 'intermediate' results of individual runs each described by the full parameter state (variable values) necessary to reproduce (withstanding any stochastic element) identical output from that task.
So a 'Scheduler' that operates on a DAG ahead of time is not useful.
In general, most existing workflow frameworks, at least in python, that I've glanced at appear more to be designed to automate many relatively simple tasks in an easily scalable and robust manner with parallelization, with little emphasis put on the incremental building up of more complex analyses with results that must be reused when possible designed to link complex and expensive computational tasks the output of which may likely in turn be used as input for an additional unforeseen analysis.
I just discovered the 'Prefect' workflow this morning, and am intrigued to learn more -- at least it is clearly well funded ;-).  My initial sense is that it may be less reliant on pre-scheduling and thus more fluid and more readily adapted to my needs, but that's just a hunch.  In many ways some of my more complex 'single' tasks might be well suited to wrap an entire Prefect Flow if they played nicely together.  It seems my needs are on the far end of the spectrum of deep complicated DAGs (I will not try to write mine out!) with never ending downstream additions. 
I'm going to look into Prefect and Luigi more closely and see what I can borrow to make my framework more robust and less baroque.  Or maybe I can add a layer of full data description to Prefect...
UPDATE -- discussing with Prefect folks, clear that I need to start with the underlying Dask and see if it is flexible enough -- perhaps using Dask delayed or futures.  Clearly Dask is extraordinary.  Graphchain built on top of Dask is a move in the right direction by facilitating permanent storage of 'intermediate' output computed over a dependency 'chain' identified by hash of code base and parameters.  Pretty close to what I need, though with more explicit handling of those parameters that deterministically define the outputs.",0.4082,0.3011585,0.0114500252529978,0.10704150000000001,554,478

Thanks","I ended up incorporating some of the feedback given above by Chris into the following possible unconventional solution for which I would appreciate getting feedback (to the specific questions below but also general suggestions for improvement or more effective/accurate tools or strategy):

Define (but not apply yet) tissue mask (HistoQC) after optimizing HistoQC script to remove as much of the tissue folds as possible without removing normal tissue area
Apply deconvolution on the original RGB image using hax_from_rgb
Using the second channel which should correspond to the red stain pixels, and subtract from it the third channel which as far as I see corresponds to the background non-red/blue pixels of the image. This step removes the high values in the second channel that which up because of tissue folds or other artifacts that weren't removed in the first step (what does the third channel correspond to? The Green element of RGB?)
Blur the adjusted image and threshold based on the median of the image plus 20 (Semi-arbitrary but it works. Are there better alternatives? Otsu doesn't work here at all)
Apply the tissue regions mask on the thresholded image yielding only positive red/red-ish pixels without the non-tissue areas
Count the % of positive pixels relative to the tissue mask area

I have been trying to apply, as suggested above, the tissue mask on the deconvolution red channel output and then use Otsu thresholding. But it failed since the black background generated by the applying the tissue regions mask makes the Otsu threshold detect the entire tissue as positive. So I have proceeded instead to apply the threshold on the adjusted red channel and then apply the tissue mask before counting positive pixels. I am interested in learning what am I doing wrong here.

multiply all pixel coordinates by 10, so that we'll only deal with integers.

For each pixel, generate the 4 corners by adding +/- 5. For example, for (20,20), the corners are (25, 25) (25, 15) (15, 15) (15, 25) (25, 25). And store all the corners in a list.

After 10000 iterations, I am getting the error maximum iteration reached and solution not found.
So can I get the value of decision variables after the 10000th iteration?
I mean even when the maximum iteration is reached the solver must have a value of decision variable in the last iteration. so I want to access that values. how can I do that?","Question:
1) I am solving an MINLP problem with APOPT Solver. And my decision variables are defined as integer. I have retrieved the result of 10,000th iteration as you suggested. but the Decision variables values are non-integer. So why APOPT Solver is calculating a non-integer solution? 
Answer:
There is an option on what is classified as an integer. The default tolerance is any number within 0.05 of an integer value. 
you can change this by:
m.solver_options = ['minlp_integer_tol 1']
2) I am running the code for ""m.options.MAX_ITER=100"" and using m = GEKKO() i.e. using remote server. But my code is still running for 10000th iterations.

m.solver_options = ['minlp_maximum_iterations 100']

36,"How can you prevent the agent from non-stop repeating the same action circle?
Of course, somehow with changes in the reward system. But are there general rules you could follow or try to include in your code to prevent such a problem?

To be more precise, my actual problem is this one:
I'm trying to teach an ANN to learn Doodle Jump using Q-Learning. After only a few generations the agent keeps jumping on one and the same platform/stone over and over again, non-stop. It doesn't help to increase the length of the random-exploration-time. 
My reward system is the following:

+1 when the agent is living
+2 when the agent jumps on a platform
-1000 when it dies

An idea would be to reward it negative or at least with 0 when the agent hits the same platform as it did before. But to do so, I'd have to pass a lot of new input-parameters to the ANN: x,y coordinates of the agent and x,y coordinates of the last visited platform.
Furthermore, the ANN then would also have to learn that a platform is 4 blocks thick, and so on. 
Therefore, I'm sure that this idea I just mentioned wouldn't solve the problem, contrarily I believe that the ANN would in general simply not learn well anymore, because there are too many unuseful and complex-to-understand inputs.","This is not a direct answer to the very generally asked question.

I found a workaround for my particular DoodleJump example, probably someone does something similar and needs help:

While training: Let every platform the agent jumped on disappear after that, and spawn a new one somewhere else.

37,"I am trying to wrap my head around vectorization (for numerical computing), and I'm coming across seemingly contradictory explanations:

My understanding is that it is a feature built into low-level libraries that takes advantage of parallel processing capabilities of a given processor to perform operations against multiple data points simultaneously.

A more concrete explanation of my dilemma: 

Let's say I have a loop to calculate an operation on a list of numbers in Python.

For example, assume your data is 32 bits, back in the old days one addition would cost one instruction (say 4 clock cycles depending on the architecture). Intel's latest SIMD instructions now process 512 bits of data all at once with one instruction, enabling you to make 16 additions in parallel.
Unless you are writing assembly code, you better make sure that your code is efficiently compiled to leverage the SIMD instruction set. This is being taking care of with the standard packages. 
Your next speed up opportunities are in writing code to leverage multicore processors and to move your loops out of the interpreted python. Again, this is being taking care of with libraries and frameworks.
If you are a data scientist, you should only care about calling the right packages/frameworks, avoid reimplementing logic already offered by the libraries (with loops being a major example) and just focus on your application.

In numpy we usually mean using the compiled numpy methods to work on whole arrays.  In effect it means moving any loops out of interpreted Python and into compiled code.  It's very specific to numpy.
I came to numpy from MATLAB years ago, and APL before that (and physics/math as a student).  Thus I've been used to thinking in terms of whole arrays/vectors/matrices for a long time.
MATLAB now has a lot just-in-time compiling, so programmers can write iterative code without a performance penalty.  numba (and cython) lets numpy users do some of the same, though there are still a lot of rough edges - as can be seen in numpa tagged questions.
Parallelization and other means of taking advantage of modern multi-core computers is a different topic.  That usually requires using additional packages.
I took issue with a comment that loops are not Pythonic.  I should qualify that a bit.  Python does have tools for avoiding large, hard to read loops, things like list comprehensions, generators and other comprehensions. Performing a complex task by stringing together comprehensions and generators is good Python practice, but that's not 'vectorization' (in the numpy sense).",0.6803,0.34963232,0.1093226671218872,0.33066768,281,261

my knowledge of C isn't good enough to infer this from the source code, nor do I know where in the source to begin looking.

In the implementation of CPython, how are object addresses stored in, or otherwise associated with, the variables which point to them?","In module scope or class scope, variables are implemented as entries in a Python dict. The pointer to the object is stored in the dict. In older CPython versions, the pointer was stored directly in the dict's underlying hash table, but since CPython 3.6, the hash table now stores an index into a dense array of dict entries, and the pointer is in that array. (There are also split-key dicts that work a bit differently. They're used for optimizing object attributes, which you might or might not consider to be variables.)
In function scope, Python creates a stack frame object to store data for a given execution of a function, and the stack frame object includes an array of pointers to variable values. Variables are implemented as entries in this array, and the pointer to the value is stored in the array, at a fixed index for each variable.

1. API getaway to receive the REST calls from the clients and transform them into the commands.
2 Command handler as a service. Receive the commands from API getaway make the validations. Save the events to the event store and publish events to the event bus.
3. Event store is the storage for all events in the system. Allows us to recreate the state of the app. The main state of truth.
4. Micro-services is small services responsible to handle the related to its domain event. Make some projections to the local private databases. Make some events too.
And I have questions that I could not answer both by myself and the internet.
1. What is actually aggregates. They are the class objects/records in databases as I think or what?
2. Who carry about aggregates. I found example that is some cases command handler use them.

Please explain me the realization of command validation due to example above.","Command handler as a service

I think this is the main source of your confusion.
The command handler isn't normally a service in itself.  It is a pattern.  It will normally be running in the same process as the ""microservice"" itself.
IE: the command handler reads a message from so storage, and itself invokes the microservice logic that computes how to integrate the information in this message into its own view of the world.

What is actually aggregates

""Aggregate"" is a lifecycle management pattern; an aggregate is a graph of one or more domain entities that together will establish and maintain some interesting invariant.  It's one of three patterns described in detail in the Domain Driven Design book written by Eric Evans.
The command handler plus your aggregate is, in a sense, your microservice.  The microservice will typically handle messages for several instances of a single aggregate - it will subscribe to all of the input messages for that kind of aggregate.  The ""handler"" part just reads the next message, loads the appropriate instance of the aggregate, then executes the domain logic (defined within the aggregate entities) and stores the results.",0.4082,0.27282634,0.0183160863816738,0.13537366,243,411

By doing:
dataframe1.cache()

dataframe2.cache()
when you join these 2 dataframes the first time both dataframes are evaluated and loaded into cache. Then when joining and writing again the 2 dataframe execution plans are already evaluated and the join and write becomes much faster.
This means the first write still takes over 30 minutes but the other 2 writes are much quicker.
Additionally, you can increase performance with additional CPUs and proper paritioning and coalesce of the dataframes. That could help with the evaluation of the first join and write operation.

For instance-level stuff, you can just pass the settings from Pyramid into the instance either from the view or from the config.
To get around this, you can always pass data into your models at config-time for your Pyramid app. For example, in your main just pull settings = config.get_settings() and pass some of them to where they need to be. As a general rule, you want to try to pass things around at config-time once, instead of from the view layer all the time.
Finally, a good way to do that without using class-level or module-level attributes is to register instances of your services with your app. pyramid_services library provides one approach to this, but the idea is basically to instantiate an instance of a service for your app, add it to your pyramid registry config.registry.foo = ... and when you do that you can pass in the settings.

I just was looking for the answer and i'm still confused about it, in the end of the day i got two different answers:
- First is that the MEDIA_ROOT is for storing images and mp3 files maybe and the STATIC_ROOT for the css, js... and so on.
-Second answer is that they were only using MEDIA_ROOT in the past for static files, and it caused some errors so eventually we are only using STATIC_ROOT.
is one of them right if not be direct and simple please so everybody can understand and by how to use them correctly i mean what kind of files to put in them exactly","Understanding the real difference between MEDIA_ROOT and STATIC_ROOT can be confusing sometimes as both of them are related to serving files.
To be clear about their differences, I could point out their uses and types of files they serve.

STATIC_ROOT, STATIC_URL and STATICFILES_DIRS are all used to serve the static files required for the website or application. Whereas, MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT are used to serve the media files uploaded by a user.

As you can see that the main difference lies between media and static files. So, let's differentiate them.

Static files are files like CSS, JS, JQuery, scss, and other images(PNG, JPG, SVG, etc. )etc. which are used in development, creation and rendering of your website or application. Whereas, media files are those files that are uploaded by the user while using the website.

So, if there is a JavaScript file named main.js which is used to give some functionalities like show popup on button click then it is a STATIC file. Similarly, images like website logo, or some static images displayed in the website that the user can't change by any action are also STATIC files. 
Hence, files(as mentioned above) that are used during the development and rendering of the website are known as STATIC files and are served by STATIC_ROOT, STATIC_URL or STATICFILES_DIRS(during deployment) in Django.
Now for the MEDIA files: any file that the user uploads, for example; a video, or image or excel file, etc. during the normal usage of the website or application are called MEDIA files in Django. 
MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL are used to point out the location of MEDIA files stored in your application.

Multiple Apache's still faces off against the browser's HTTP calls.
Each Apache instance uses an AMQP plugin and then posts message to a queue
Python microservices monitor a queue and pull a message, service it and return response
Response passed back to Apache plugin, in turn Apache generates the HTTP response 

Does this mean the Python microservice no longer has any HTTP server code at all.  This will change that component a lot.  Perhaps best to decide upfront if you want to use this pattern as it seems it would be a task to rip out any HTTP server code.

The API provider might have an option to call your API when something is updated on their side. It is a similar mechanism to push notifications. If they provide a method to do that, you can create an endpoint on your side to do whatever you need to do when a new purchase is made, and provide them the endpoint.

Thanks in advance.","So, this is where the work comes in. 
Normally people start with a stop word list. There are several, choose wisely. But more than likely you'll experiment and/or use a base list and then add more words to that list.
Depending on the list it will take out 

""what, is, the, for, ?""

Since this a pretty easy example, they'll all do that. But you'll notice that what is being done is just the opposite of what you wanted. You asked for domain-specific words but what is happening is the removal of all that other cruft (to the library).
From here it will depend on what you use. NLTK or Spacy are common choices. Regardless of what you pick, get a real understanding of concepts or it can bite you (like pretty much anything in Data Science).
Expect to start thinking in terms of linguistic patterns so, in your example:

What is the maturity date for TRADE:12345 ? 

'What' is an interrogative, 'the' is a definite article, 'for' starts a prepositional phrase.
There may be other clues such as the ':' or that TRADE is in all caps. But, it might not be.
That should get you started but you might look at some of the other StackExchange sites for deeper expertise.

Now to answer this question:

Try doing it this way:

Modify your script to use threads and/or processes.
You will have for example a continously running thread which would be the camera.
You would have another non blocking thread listening to IO commands.
Your IO commands would be comming through command line arguments.
Your IO thread upon recieving an IO command would redirect your running camera thread to a specific function as needed.

Longer answer:
If you want them to be able connect then you have no choice but to give them the cert/private key that identifies that device/user.
The control you have is issue each contractor with their own unique key/cert and if you believe key/cert has been miss used, revoke the cert at the CA and have the broker check the revocation list.
You can protect the private key with a password, but again you have to either include this in the code or give it to the contractor.
Even if the contractors were using a device with a hardware keystore (secure element) that you could securely store the private key in, all that would do is stop the user from extracting the key and moving it to a different machine, they would still be able to make use of the private key for what ever they want on that machine.
The best mitigation is to make sure the certificate has a short life and control renewing the certificate, this means if a certificate is leaked then it will stop working quickly even if you don't notice and explicitly revoke it.",0.4082,0.27785987,0.0169789791107177,0.13034013,228,239

64,"TL;DR
What's the fasted way to get near-zero loading time for a pandas dataset I have in memory, using ray?
Background
I'm making an application which uses semi-large datasets (pandas dataframes between 100MB to 700MB) and are trying to reduce each query time. For a lot of my queries the data loading is the majority of the response times. The datasets are optimized parquet files (categories instead of strings, etc) which only reads the columns it needs. 
Currently I use a naive approach that per-requests loads the require dataset (reading the 10-20 columns out of 1000 I need from the dataset) and then filter out the rows I need. 
A typical request:

Read and parse the contract (~50-100ms)    
Load the dataset (10-20 columns) (400-1200ms)    
Execute pandas operations (~50-100ms)
Serialise the results (50-100ms)

I'm now trying to speed this up (reduce or remove the load dataset step). 
Things I have tried:

Use Arrow's new row-level filtering on the dataset to only read the rows I need as well. This is probably a good way in the future, but for now the new Arrow Dataset API which is relies on is significantly slower than reading the full file using the legacy loader. 
Optimize the hell out of the datasets. This works well to a point, where things are in categories, the data types is optimized. 
Store the dataframe in Ray. Using ray.put and ray.get. However this doesn't actually improve the situation since the time consuming part is deserialization of the dataframe. 
Put the dataset in ramfs. This doesn't actually improve the situation since the time consuming part is deserialization of the dataframe.
Store the object in another Plasma store (outside of ray.put) but obviously the speed is the same (even though I might get some other benefits)

The datasets are parquet files, which is already pretty fast for serialization/deserialization. I typically select about 10-20 columns (out of 1000) and about 30-60% of the rows. 
Any good ideas on how to speed up the loading? I haven't been able to find any near zero-copy operations for pandas dataframes (i.e without the serialization penalty). 
Things that I am thinking about:

Placing the dataset in an actor, and use one actor per thread. That would probably give the actor direct access to the dataframe without any serialization, but would require me to do a lot of handling of:

Making sure I have an actor per thread
Distribute requests per threads
""Recycle"" the actors when the dataset gets updated

72,"I have a flask app that is intended to be hosted on multiple host. That is, the same app is running on different hosts. Each host can then send a request to the others host to take some action on the it's respective system. 
For example, assume that there is systems A and B both running this flask app. A knows the IP address of B and the port number that the app is hosted on B. A gets a request via a POST intended for B. A then needs to forward this request to B. 
I have the forwarding being done in a route that simply checks the JSON attached to the POST to see if it is the intended host. If not is uses python's requests library to make a POST request to the other host. 
My issue is how do I simulate this environment (two different instance of the same app with different ports) in a python unittest so I can confirm that the forwarding is done correctly?
Right now I am using the app.test_client() to test most of the routes but as far as I can tell the app.test_client() does not contain a port number or IP address associated with it. So having the app POST to another app.test_client() seems unlikely.

They can (sometimes) cache results saving lots of time.

I cant seem to find suitable extensions for data science and its related modules (like statsmodels, pandas etc). Thanks a lot!","First of all, a quick description of anaconda:
Anaconda is meant to help you manage multiple python ""environments"", each one potentially having its own python version and installed packages (with their own respective versions). This is really useful in cases where you would like multiple python versions for different tasks or when there is some conflict in versions of packages, required by other ones. By default, anaconda creates a ""base"" environment with a specific python version, IDLE and pip. Also, anaconda provides an improved way (with respect to pip) of installing and managing packages via the command conda install <package-name>.
For the rest, I will be using the word ""vanilla"" to refer to the python/installation that you manually set up, independent of anaconda.
Explanation of the problem:
Now, the problem arises since you also installed python independently. The details of the problem depend on how exactly you set up both python and anaconda, so I cannot tell you exactly what went wrong. Also, I am not an OSX user, so I have no idea how python is installed and what it downloads/sets alongside.
By your description however, it seems that the ""vanilla"" python installation did not overwrite neither your anaconda python nor anaconda's pip, but it did install IDLE and set it up to use this new python.
So right now, when you are downloading something via pip, only the python from anaconda is able to see that and not IDLE's python.
Possible solutions:
1. Quick fix:
Just run IDLE via /Users/myname/anaconda3/bin/idle3 every time. This one uses anaconda's python and should be able to see all packages installed via conda install of pip install (*). I get this is tiresome, but you don't have to delete anything. You can also set an ""alias"" in your ~/.bashrc file to make the command idle specifically linking you there. Let me know with a comment if you would like me to explain how to do that, as this answer will get too long and redundant.
2. Remove conda altogether (not recommended)
You can search google on how to uninstall anaconda along with everything that it has installed. What I do not know at this point is whether your ""vanilla"" python will become the default, whether you will need to also manually install pip again and whether there is the need to reinstall python in order for everything to work properly.
3. Remove your python ""vanilla"" installation and only use anaconda
Again, I do not know how python installation works in OSX, but it should be reasonably straightforward to uninstall it. The problem now is that probably you will not have a launcher for IDLE (since I am guessing anaconda doesn't provide one on OSX) but you will be able to use it via the terminal as described in 1..
4. Last resort:
If everything fails, simply uninstall both your vanilla python (which I presume will also uninstall IDLE) and anaconda which will uninstall its own python, pip and idle versions. The relevant documentation should not be difficult to follow. Then, reinstall whichever you want anew.
Finally:
When you solve your problems, any IDE you choose, being VScode (I haven't use that either), pycharm or something else, will probably be able to integrate with your installed python. There is no need to install a new python ""bundle"" with every IDE.

(*): Since you said that after typing pip install pandas your anaconda's python can import pandas while IDLE cannot, I am implying in my answer that pip is also the one that comes with anaconda. You can make sure this is the case by typing which pip which should point to an anaconda directory, probably /Users/myname/anaconda3/bin/pip",0.1361,0.25478327,0.0140965385362505,0.11868327000000001,833,450

Web scraping allows you to extract data from any website through the use of web scraping software. On the other hand, APIs give you direct access to the data you’d want.

In these scenarios, web scraping would allow you to access the data as long as it is available on a website.

91,"Background:
I have multiple asset tables stored in a redshift database for each city, 8 cities in total. These asset tables display status updates on an hourly basis. 8 SQL tables and about 500 mil rows of data in a year.
(I also have access to the server that updates this data every minute.)

Example: One market can have 20k assets displaying 480k (20k*24 hrs) status updates a day.

These status updates are in a raw format and need to undergo a transformation process that is currently written in a SQL view. The end state is going into our BI tool (Tableau) for external stakeholders to look at.
Problem:
The current way the data is processed is slow and inefficient, and probably not realistic to run this job on an hourly basis in Tableau. The status transformation requires that I look back at 30 days of data, so I do need to look back at the history throughout the query.
Possible Solutions:
Here are some solutions that I think might work, I would like to get feedback on what makes the most sense in my situation.

Run a python script that looks at the most recent update and query the large history table 30 days as a cron job and send the result to a table in the redshift database.
Materialize the SQL view and run an incremental refresh every hour
Put the view in Tableau as a datasource and run an incremental refresh every hour

Please let me know how you would approach this problem. My knowledge is in SQL, limited Data Engineering experience, Tableau (Prep & Desktop) and scripting in Python or R.","So first things first - you say that the data processing is ""slow and inefficient"" and ask how to efficiently query a large database.  First I'd look at how to improve this process.  You indicate that the process is based on the past 30 days of data - is the large tables time sorted, vacuumed and analyzed?  It is important to take maximum advantage of metadata when working with large tables.  Make sure your where clauses are effective at eliminating fact table block - don't rely on dimension table where clauses to select the date range.
Next look at your distribution keys and how these are impacting the need for your critical query to move large amounts of data across the network.  The internode network has the lowest bandwidth in a Redshift cluster and needlessly pushing lots of data across it will make things slow and inefficient.  Using EVEN distribution can be a performance killer depending on your query pattern.  
Now let me get to your question and let me paraphrase - ""is it better to use summary tables, materialized views, or external storage (tableau datasource) to store summary data updated hourly?""  All 3 work and each has its own pros and cons.  

Summary tables are good because you can select the distribution of the data storage and if this data needs to be combined with other database tables it can be done most efficiently.  However, there is more data management to be performed to keep this data up to data and in sync.
Materialized views are nice as there is a lot less management action to worry about - when the data changes, just refresh the view.  The data is still in the database so is is easy to combine with other data tables but since you don't have control over storage of the data these action may not be the most efficient.
External storage is good in that the data is in your BI tool so if you need to refetch the results during the hour the data is local.  However, it is not locked into your BI tool and far less efficient to combine with other database tables.  

Summary data usually isn't that large so how it is stored isn't a huge concern and I'm a bit lazy so I'd go with a materialized view.  Like I said at the beginning I'd first look at the ""slow and inefficient"" queries I'm running every hour first.

But in general:

You might not need word2vec at all: there are many text-classification approaches that, with sufficient training data, may assign your texts to helpful classes without using word-vectors. You will likely want to try those first, then consider word-vectors as a later improvement.
For word-vectors to be helpful, they need to be based on your actual language, and also ideally your particular domain-of-concern. Generic word-vectors from news articles or even Wikipedia may not include the important lingo, and word-senses for your problem. But it's not too hard to train your own word-vectors – you just need a lot of varied, relevant texts that use the words in realistic, relevant contexts. So yes, you'd ideally train your word-vectors on the same texts you eventually want to classify. 

But mostly, if you're ""totally lost"", start with more simple text-classification examples. As you're using Python, examples based on scikit-learn may be most relevant. Adapt those to your data & goals, to familiarize yourself with all the steps & the ways of evaluating whether your changes are improving your end results or not.

If you're interested in the specific lines of code rather than the metadata, p4 annotate is the best way.  Use p4 describe 123 to see the lines of code changed in 123, and then p4 annotate -c v5.0/(file) to locate the same lines of code in v5.0 and see which changelist(s) introduced them into that branch.  This method will work even if the changes were copied over manually instead of using Perforce's merge commands.
If you want to track the integration history (i.e. the metadata) rather than the exact lines of code (which may have been edited in the course of being merged between codelines, making the annotate method not work), the easiest method is to use the Revision Graph tool in P4V, which lets you visually inspect a file's branching history; you can select the revision from change 123 and use the ""highlight ancestors and descendants"" tool to see which revisions/changelists it is connected to in other codelines.  This makes it easy to see the context of how many integration steps were involved, who did them, when they happened, whether there were edits in between, etc.

The entire Pipeline you are using seems to be a sequential one. Your best bet is to first supply input to the first network, get its output, apply some trigger to activate the second network, feed the output of the first net into the second net, and lastly get the output of the second net. You can run both of these networks in separate GPUs.
The Trigger that calls the second function can be something as simple as cropping the located object in local storage and have a function running that checks for any changes in the file structure(adding a new file). If this function returns true you can grab that cropped object and run the network with this image as input.",0.0,0.35318953,0.1247428432106971,0.35318953,193,109

Hi, I have a collection of APIs that I run on Postman using POST requests. The flask and redis servers are set up using docker.
What I'm trying to do
I need to profile my setup/APIs in a high traffic environment. So,

I need to create concurrent requests calling these APIs

The profiling aims to get the system conditions with respect to memory (total memory consumed by the application), time (total execution time taken to create and execute the requests) and CPU-time (or the percentage of CPU consumption)


What I have tried
I am familiar with some memory profilers like mprof and time profiler like line_profiler. But I could not get a profiler for the CPU consumption. I have run the above two profilers (mprof and line_profiler) on a single execution to get the line-by-line profiling results for my code. But this focuses on the function wise results.I have also created parallel requests earlier using asyncio,etc but that was for some simple API-like programs without POSTMAN. My current APIs work with a lot of data in the body section of POSTMAN
Where did I get stuck
With docker, this problem gets trickier for me.

Firstly, I am unable to get concurrent requests

I do not know how to profile my APIs when using POSTMAN (perhaps there is an option to do it without POSTMAN) with respect to the three parameters: time, memory and CPU consumption.","I suppose that you've been using the embbed flask server(dev server) that is NOT production ready and,by default, it supports only on request per time.

Bobby","So to summarise this is what I have found on this issue (in my experience):
to run the jupyter app you can use the jupyter-notebook command and this works,  but why? This is because, the jupyter-notebook is stored in usr/local/bin which is normally always stored in the PATH variable.
I then discovered that the jupyter notebook or jupyter --version command will now work if I did the following:

open my ./bash_profile file
add the following to the bottom of the file: export PATH=$PATH:/Users/your-home-directory/Library/Python/3.7/bin

this should add the location of where jupyter is located to your path variable.

It works locally when I execute the script from my command line, but I would like to make it happen automatically so that the externally added events pop up in my Google Calendar automatically.
It appears that a cron job is the best way to do this, and given I used Google Calendar's API, I thought it might be helpful to use Cloud Functions with Cloud Scheduler in order to make it happen. However, I really don't know where to start and if this is even possible because accessing the API requires OAuth with Google to my personal Google account which is something I don't think a service account (which I think I need) can do on my behalf.
What are the steps I need to take in order to allow the script which I manually run and authenticates me with Google Calendar run every 60 seconds ideally in the cloud so that I don't need to have my computer on at all times?
Things I’ve tried to do:
I created a service account with full permissions and tried to create an http-trigger event that would theoretically run the script when the created URL is hit. However, it just returns an HTTP 500 Error.
I tried doing Pub/Sub event targets to listen and execute the script, but that doesn’t work either.
Something I’m confused about:
with either account, there needs to be a credentials.json file in order to login; how does this file get “deployed” alongside the main function? Along with the token.pickle file that gets created when the authentication happens for the first time.","The way a service account works is that it needs to be preauthorized.  You would take the service account email address and share a calendar with it like you would with any other user.  The catch here being that you should only be doing this with calendars you the developer control.  If these are calendars owned by others you shouldnt be using a service account.
The way Oauth2 works is that a user is displayed a consent screen to grant your application access to their data.  Once the user has granted you access and assuming you requested offline access you should have a refresh token for that users account.  Using the refresh token you can request a new access token at anytime.  So the trick here would be storing the users refresh tokens in a place that your script can access it then when the cron job runs the first thing it needs to do is request a new access token using its refresh token.
So the only way you will be able to do this as a cron job is if you have a refresh token stored for the account you want to access. Other wise it will require it to open a web browser to request the users consent and you cant do that with a cron job.",0.8163,0.32441688,0.2419751286506652,0.49188312,245,357

40,"I recently migrated my Python / Jupyter work from a macbook to a refurbrished Gen 8 HP rackmounted server (192GB DDR3 2 x 8C Xeon E5-2600), which I got off amazon for $400. The extra CPU cores have dramatically improved the speed of fitting my models particularly for decision tree ensembles that I tend to use a lot. I am now thinking of buying additional servers from that era (early-mid 2010s) (either dual or quad-socket intel xeon E5, E7 v1/v2) and wiring them up as a small HPC cluster in my apartment. Here's what I need help deciding:

Is this a bad idea? Am I better off buying a GPU (like a gtx 1080). The reason I am reluctant to go the GPU route is that I tend to rely on sklearn a lot (that's pretty much the only thing I know and use). And from what I understand model training on gpus is not currently a part of the sklearn ecosystem. All my code is written in numpy/pandas/sklearn. So, there will be a steep learning curve and backward compatibility issues. Am I wrong about this?

Assuming (1) is true and CPUs are indeed better for me in the short term. How do I build the cluster and run Jupyter notebooks on it. Is it as simple as buying an additional server. Designating one of the servers as the head node. Connecting the servers through ethernet. Installing Centos / Rocks on both machines. And starting the Jupyter server with IPython Parallel (?).

Assuming (2) is true, or at least partly true. What other hardware / software do I need to get? Do I need an ethernet switch? Or if I am connecting only two machines, there's no need for it? Or do I need a minimum of three machines to utilize the extra CPU cores and thus need a switch? Do I need to install Centos / Rocks? Or are there better, more modern alternatives for the software layer. For context, right now I use openSUSE on the HP server, and I am pretty much a rookie when it comes to operating systems and networking.

How homogeneous should my hardware be? Can I mix and match different frequency CPUs and memory across the machines? For example, having 1600 MHz DDR3 memory in one machine, 1333 MHz DDR3 in another? Or using 2.9 GHz E5-2600v1 and 2.6 GHz E5-2600v2 CPUs?

Should I be worried about power? I.e. can I safely plug three rackmounted servers in the same power strip in my apartment? There's one outlet that I know if I plug my hairdryer in, the lights go out. So I should probably avoid that one :) Seriously, how do I run 2-3 multi-CPU machines under load and avoid tripping the circuit breaker?

43,"I'm running a Python script in an AWS Lambda function. It is triggered by SQS messages that tell the script certain objects to load from an S3 bucket for further processing.
The permissions seem to be set up correctly, with a bucket policy that allows the Lambda's execution role to do any action on any object in the bucket. And the Lambda can access everything most of the time. The objects are being loaded via pandas and s3fs: pandas.read_csv(f's3://{s3_bucket}/{object_key}').
However, when a new object is uploaded to the S3 bucket, the Lambda can't access it at first. The botocore SDK throws An error occurred (403) when calling the HeadObject operation: Forbidden when trying to access the object. Repeated invocations (even 50+) of the Lambda over several minutes (via SQS) give the same error. However, when invoking the Lambda with a different SQS message (that loads different objects from S3), and then re-invoking with the original message, the Lambda can suddenly access the S3 object (that previously failed every time). All subsequent attempts to access this object from the Lambda then succeed.
I'm at a loss for what could cause this. This repeatable 3-step process (1) fail on newly-uploaded object, 2) run with other objects 3) succeed on the original objects) can happen all on one Lambda container (they're all in one CloudWatch log stream, which seems to correlate with Lambda containers). So, it doesn't seem to be from needing a fresh Lambda container/instance.

This can sometimes (often?) lead to problems, especially where files are being quickly created, updated and deleted. It can take some time for s3fs to update S3 to match what is expected from a local filesystem.
Therefore, it is not recommended to use tools like s3fs to 'mount' S3 as a filesystem, especially for Production use. It is better to call the AWS API directly.",0.8163,0.40426463,0.1697950363159179,0.41203537,159,363

87,"I'm reviewing the concepts of OOP, reading .
Here the book defines interface as

The set of all signatures defined by an object’s operations is called the interface to the object. (p.39)

And the abstract class as

An abstract class is one whose main purpose is to define a common interface for its subclasses. An abstract class will defer some or all of its implementation to operations defined in subclasses; hence an abstract class cannot be instantiated. The operations that an abstract class declares but doesn’t implement are called abstract operations. Classes that aren’t abstract are called concrete classes. (p.43)

And I wonder, if I define an abstract class without any internal data (variables) and concrete operations, just some abstract operations, isn't it effectively just a set of signatures? Isn't it then just an interface?
So this is my first question:

Can I say an abstract class with only abstract functions is ""effectively (or theoretically)"" an interface?

Then I thought, the book also says something about types and classes.

An object’s class defines how the object is implemented. The class defines the object’s internal state and the implementation of its operations. In contrast, an object’s type only refers to its interface—the set of requests to which it can respond. An object can have many types, and objects of different classes can have the same type. (p.44)

Then I remembered that some languages, like Java, does not allow multiple inheritance while it allows multiple implementation. So I guess for some languages (like Java), abstract class with only abstract operations != interfaces.
So this is my second question:

Can I say an abstract class with only abstract functions is ""generally equivalent to"" an interface in languages that support multiple inheritance?

My first question was like checking definitions, and the second one is about how other languages work. I mainly use Java and Kotlin so I'm not so sure about other languages that support multiple inheritance. I do not expect a general, comprehensive review on current OOP languages, but just a little hint on single language (maybe python?) will be very helpful.","No.

In Java, every class is a subclass of Object, so you can't make an abstract class with only abstract methods.  It will always have the method implementations inherited from Object:  hashCode(), equals(), toString(), etc.

Yes, pretty much.

In C++, for example, there is no specific interface keyword, and an interface is just a class with no implementations.  There is no universal base class in C++, so you can really make a class with no implementations.
Multiple inheritance is not really the deciding feature.  Java has multiple inheritance of a sort, with special classes called ""interfaces"" that can even have default methods.

13,"I need help understanding the security of JWT tokens used for login functionality. Specifically, how does it prevent an attack from an attacker who can see the user's packets? My understanding is that, encrypted or not, if an attacker gains access to a token, they'll be able to copy the token and use it to login themselves and access a protected resource. I have read that this is why the time-to-live of a token should be short. But how much does that actually help? It doesn't take long to grab a resource. And if the attacker could steal a token once, can't they do it again after the refressh?
Is there no way to verify that a token being sent by a client is being sent from the same client that you sent it to? Or am I missing the point?","how does it prevent an attack from an attacker who can see the user's packets?

Just because you can see someone's packets doesn't mean that you can see the contents. HTTPS encrypts the traffic so even if someone manages to capture your traffic, they will no be able to extract JWT out of it. Every website that is using authentication should only run through HTTPS. If someone is able to perform man-in-the-middle attack then that is a different story.

they'll be able to copy the token and use it to login themselves and access a protected resource

Yes but only as the user they stole the token from. JWT are signed which means that you can't modify their content without breaking the signature which will be detected by the server (at least it is computationally infeasible to find the hash collision such that you could modify the content of the JWT). For highly sensitive access (bank accounts, medical data, enterprise cloud admin accounts...) you will need at least 2-factor authentication.

And if the attacker could steal a token once, can't they do it again after the refressh?

Possibly but that depends on how the token has been exposed. If the attacked sits on the unencrypted channel between you and the server then sure they can repeat the same process but this exposure might be a result of a temporary glitch/human mistake which might be soon repaired which will prevent attack to use the token once it expires.

Is there no way to verify that a token being sent by a client is being sent from the same client that you sent it to?

If the attacker successfully performs man-in-the-middle attack, they can forge any information that you might use to verify the client so the answer is no, there is no 100% reliable way to verify the client.

Trying to run a Python Flask API in Kubernetes hosted in Raspberry Pi cluster, nodes are running Ubuntu 20. The API is containerized into a Docker container on the Raspberry Pi control node to account for architecture differences (ARM).

Investigations show that the exec format error might be associated with problems related to building against different CPU architectures.

It has been two days and all attempts have failed. Can anyone help?","Fixed; however, something doesn't seem right.
The Kubernetes Deployment was always deployed onto the same node. I connected to that node and ran the Docker container and it wouldn't run; the ""exec format error"" would occur. So, it looks like it was a node specific problem.
I copied the API and Dockerfile onto the node and ran Docker build to create the image. It now runs. That does not make sense as the Docker image should have everything it needs to run.
Maybe it's because a previous image build against x86 (the development machine) remained in that nodes Docker cache/repository. Maybe the image on the node is not overwritten with newer images that have the same name and version number (the version number didn't increment). That would seem the case as the spin up time of the image on the remote node is fast suggesting the new image isn't copied on the remote node. That likely to be what it is.
I will post this anyway as it might be useful.

Edit: allow me to clarify some more, the root of this problem was ultimately because there was no shared image repository in the cluster. Images were being manually copied onto each RPI (running ARM64) from a laptop (not running ARM64) and this manual process caused the problem.
An image build on the laptop was based from a base image incompatible with ARM64; this was manually copied to all RPI's in the cluster. This caused the Exec Format error.
Building the image on the RPI pulled a base image that supported ARM64; however, this build had to be done on all RPI because there was no central repository in the cluster that Kubernetes could pull newly build ARM64 compatible images to other RPI nodes in the cluster.
Solution: a shared repository

I'm wondering how can this be. Are the built-in types in python inefficient in comparison to some external library?
Edit: The structure is loaded from json file. So no internal references between objects","This is normal and it's all about space vs. time tradeoff. Memory layout depends on the way how a particular data structure is implemented, which in turn depends on how it is going to be used.
A general-purpose dictionary is typically implemented with a hashtable. It has a fixed-size list of buckets that store key-value pairs. The number of items in a dictionary can be smaller, equal or bigger that number of buckets. If smaller, space is wasted. If bigger, dictionary operations take a long time. A hashtable implementation usually starts with a small initial bucket list, then grow it as new items are added to keep the performance decent. However, resizing also requires rehashing which is computationally very expensive, so whenever you do it, you want to leave some room for growth. General-purpose dictionaries are a trade-off between space and time because they don't ""know"" how many elements they are supposed to contain and because there is no perfect hash function. But in a good-enough case, a general-use hashtable will give you near-O(1) performance.
When data is serialized it's a different story. Data in transit does not change, you are not doing lookups with it, it is not subjected to garbage collection, boundary alignment and so on. This means you can simply pack keys and values one after another for space efficiency. You need virtually no metadata and no control structures as long as the values can be reconstructed. On the downside, manipulating packed data is very slow because all operations take O(n) time.
For this reason, you will almost always want to:

convert data from time-efficient into space-efficient format before sending it
convert data from space-efficient into time-efficient format after receiving it.

If you are using nested dictionaries (or lists, which are in many ways similar), the differences will add up and become even more pronounced. When you know the number of items in advance and the data does not change much, you can probably get some improvement by preallocating the memory for it, such as dict.fromkeys(range(count)).",0.0,0.36680096,0.1345429420471191,0.36680096,445,121

the time in the timestamp + 5 minutes is reached.

creating a new timestamp, since the starting time wouldnt be the

using ""localhost:..."" as an adress. So now I wonder how I can make the webserver
public in the most easy way possible. The other option would be an

Thank you","Does this mean that the PyTorch training is using 33 processes X 15 GB = 495 GB of memory?

Not necessary. You have a worker process (with several subprocesses - workers) and the CPU has several cores. One worker usually loads one batch. The next batch can already be loaded and ready to go by the time the main process is ready for another batch. This is the secret for the speeding up.
I guess, you should use far less num_workers.
It would be interesting to know your batch size too, which you can adapt for the training process as well.

Is there a more accurate way of calculating the total amount of RAM being used by the main PyTorch program and all its child DataLoader worker processes?

I was googling but could not find a concrete formula. I think that it is a rough estimation of how many cores has your CPU and Memory and Batch Size.
To choose the num_workers  depends on what kind of computer you are using, what kind of dataset you are taking, and how much on-the-fly pre-processing your data requires.

(Side note: the training images (28px by 28px) and labels are stored in Numpy arrays)
At the moment, I can see 2 different ways to implement it:

My training images are in a Numpy array of [60000,28,28]. Reshape this into a [25 (num batches), 2400 (num images in batch), 28,28] and then use a for loop to call each batch and pass it the model.compile() method. The only thing that I am worried about with this method is that for loops are inherently slow, and a vectorised implementation would be much quicker.

Combine the images and labels into a tensorflow dataset object, and then call the Dataset.batch() method and Dataset.prefetch() method, and then pass the data to the model.compile() method. The only problem with this is that my data doesn't remain as a Numpy array, which I feel have more flexibility than tensorflow dataset objects.

84,"I am currently working on automating commands for a Docker container with a Python script on the host machine. This Python script for now, builds and runs a docker-compose file, with the commands for the containers written into the docker-compose file and the Dockerfile itself.
What I want to do is have the Python script action all commands to run within the container, so if I have different scripts I want to run, I am not changing the container. I have tried 2 ways.
First was to run os.system() command within the Python script, however, this works only as far as opening the shell for the container, the os.system() command does not execute code in the Docker container itself.
The second way uses CMD within the Dockerfile, however, this is limited and is hard coded to the container. If I have multiple scripts I have to change the Dockerfile, I don't want this. What I want is to build a default container with all services running, then run Python scripts on the host to run a sequence of commands on the container.
I am fairly new to Docker and think there must be something I am overlooking to run scripted commands on the container. One possible solution I have come across is nsenter. Is this a reliable solve and how does it work?  Or is there a much simpler way?

K-means is not a preferred option. K-means requires continuous features as input, as it is based on computing distances, like many clustering algorithms. So no boolean inputs. And although binary input (0-1) works, it does not compute distances in a very meaningful way (many points will have the same distance to each other). In case of 0-1 data only, I would not use clustering, but would recommend tabulating the data and see what cells occur frequently. If you have a large data set you might use the Apriori algorithm to find cells that occur frequently.
In general, a clustering algorithm typically returns a cluster number for each observation. In low-dimensions, this number is frequently used to give a color to an observation in a scatter plot.

I am pretty confident my model learns the data I provided well enough, but now it's time I found out the exact model hyperparameters and try to avoid overfitting. Since the movielens dataset only provided me with 5-fold train-test datasets without validation sets, I want to split the original dataset by myself to validate my model.
Since the movielens dataset holds 943 user data with each user guaranteed to have ranked at least 20 movies, I'm thinking of splitting the data so that both TRAIN and TEST datasets contain the same number of users(e.g. 943), and distributing 80% of the implicit feedback data to TRAIN, and the other to TEST. After training validation will take place using the mean value of Recall at k precision through all 943 users.
Is this the right way to split the dataset? I am curious because the original movielens test dataset doesn't seem to contain test data for all 943 users. If a certain user doesn't have any test data to predict, how do I evaluate using recall@k -- when doing so would cause a zero division?

I've heard from many that these are the most important data structures asked in interviews and coding competitions.
So my question is, Is there a way to implement all the said data structures without using classes and just by using predefined data structures like lists, dictionaries etc?","If we are being pedantic, everything in python is a class, so you can't avoid them. If you are concerned about everything that goes into creating your own class, like which methods should be defined where, that's something we can focus on. In fact, there is no general consensus on the boundaries to any given class and popular programs like C and Go don't even have them.
An alternative is to just use a dict to hold key/value pairs. Roughly, a class is just a dictionary with associated methods anyway. Dictionary keys can hold a wide variety of objects (as long as they are hashable) whereas class attributes must be strings and are further restricted to fit lexicographically in a program. A linked list for instance could be { ""next object"":obj, ""previous object"":obj, ""item"":obj } or even a list [obj, obj, obj] and your code remembers what those indexes are.
But classes are very convenient, especially when implementing other data structures. It makes sense that methods manipulating a linked list node would be on the node itself. There isn't much to gain avoiding classes when they are reasonable data structures to use.

41,"It seems that non-python resources are included in python distribution packages one of 4 ways:

Manifest.in file (I'm not sure when this is preferred over package_data or data_files)
package_data in setup.py (for including resources within python import packages)
data_files in setup.py (for including resources outside python import packages)
something called setuptools-scm (which I believe uses your version control system to find resources instead of manifest.in or something)

command: python3 CD_Subject_Area.py python3 CD_SA_URLS.py
Please let me know how I could call more than one script at a time. Thanks!","To run a couple of short-term (ie. run and eventually exit) commands you would want to use Cloud Foundry tasks. The reason to use tasks over adding a custom command into manifest.yml or a Procfile is because the tasks will only run once.
If you add the commands above, as you have them, they may run many times. This is because an application on Cloud Foundry will run and should execute forever. If it exits, the platform considers it to have crashed and will restart it. Thus when your task ends, even if it is successful (i.e. exit 0), the platfrom still thinks it's a crash and will run it again, and again, and again. Until you stop your app.
With a task, you'd do the following instead:

cf push your application. This will start and stage the application. You can simply leave the command/-c argument as empty and do not include a Procfile[1][2]. The push will execute, the buildpack will run and stage your app, and then it will fail to start because there is no command. That is OK.

Run cf stop to put your app into the stopped state. This will tell the platform to stop trying to restart it.

Run cf run-task <app-name> <command>. For example, cf run-task my-cool-app ""python3 CD_Subject_Area.py"". This will execute the task in it's own container. The task will run to completion. Looking at cf tasks <app-name> will show you the result. Using cf logs <app-name> --recent will show you the output.


You can then repeat this to run any number of other tasks commands. You don't need to wait for the original one to run. They will all execute in separate containers so one task is totally separated from another task.

[1] - An alternative is to set the command to sleep 99999 or something like that, don't map a route, and set the health check type to process. The app should then start successfully. You'll still stop it, but this just avoids an unseemly error.
[2] - If you've already set a command and want to back that out, remove it from your manifest.yml and run cf push -c null, or simply cf delete your app and cf push it again. Otherwise, the command will be retained in Cloud Controller, which isn't what you'd want.",0.0,0.30887175,0.095401756465435,0.30887175,519,82

I have many files with data points (X,Y) that I want to fit (each file) with the model to study how the parameters change. The model is non-linear with respect to the independent variable and all the parameters.
To fit the model, I use scipy.optimize curve_fit in Python inside a for loop throughout the files with the data points.

The experience tells me that these large variances might be due to the fact that the parameter A could be correlated to any of the others.

Set the pos attribute of a widget to control its position, or better in this case use a layout that does what you want. For instance, adding your squares to a GridLayout with the right number of columns will have the right effect without you needing to worry more about positioning them.

Should I create 32 transparent widgets placed on black tiles of board.png or it is impossible?

I don't understand what you're asking here. You can make transparent widgets if you want but I don't know why you'd want to.

To support input events, you'll need a kind of callback prepared to receive the incoming notes on and off (which are the main relevant messages for a keyboard) at any time. That also means that you have to filter the received events that are not of those types because, in MIDI, a stream of events is subject to contain many kinds of other events mixed with the notes (pitch bend, controllers, program change, and so on).
Finally notice that MIDI doesn't produce any sound by itself. So if you plane to hear something when you play on your keyboard, the produced MIDI events should be send to a device subject to produce the sound (for instance a synthesizer or virtual instrument) via a port that this device receives.

Thanks a lot.","From what I understand, MNE raw object represent a single trial (with many channels). Am I correct?

An MNE raw object represents a whole EEG recording. If you want to separate the recording into several trials, then you have to transform the raw object into an ""epoch"" object (with mne.Epochs()). You will receive an object with the shape (n_epochs, n_channels and n_times).

47,"I appear to be missing some fundamental Python concept that is so simple that no one ever talks about it.  I apologize in advance for likely using improper description - I probably don't know enough to ask the question correctly.
Here is a conceptual dead end I have arrived at:
I have an instance of Class Net, which handles communicating with some things over the internet.
I have an instance of Class Process, which does a bunch of processing and data management
I have an instance of Class Gui, which handles the GUI.
The Gui instance needs access to Net and Process instances, as the callbacks from its widgets call those methods, among other things.
The Net and Process instances need access to some of the Gui instances' methods, as they need to occasionally display stuff (what it's doing, results of queries, etc)
How do I manage it so these things talk to each other?  Inheritance doesn't work - I need the instance, not the class.  Besides, inheritance is one way, not two way.
I can obviously instantiate the Gui, and then pass it (as an object) to the others when they are instantiated.  But the Gui then won't know about the Process and Net instances.  I can of course then manually pass the Net and Process instances to the Gui instance after creation, but that seems like a hack, not like proper practice.  Also the number of interdependencies I have to manually pass along grows rather quickly (almost factorially?) with the number of objects involved - so I expect this is not the correct strategy.
I arrived at this dead end after trying the same thing with normal functions, where I am more comfortable.  Due to their size, the similarly grouped functions lived in separate modules, again Net, Gui, and Process.  The problem was exactly the same.  A 'parent' module imports 'child' modules, and can then can call their methods.  But how do the child modules call the parent module's methods, and how do they call each other's methods?

51,"Problem statement:
I have a python 3.8.5 script running on Windows 10 that processes large files from multiple locations on a network drive and creates .png files containing graphs of the analyzed results.  The graphs are all stored in a single destination folder on the same network drive.  It looks something like this
Source files:
\\drive\src1\src1.txt
\\drive\src2\src2.txt
\\drive\src3\src3.txt
Output folder:
\\drive\dest\out1.png
\\drive\dest\out2.png
\\drive\dest\out3.png
Occasionally we need to replot the original source file and examine a portion of the data trace in detail.  This involves hunting for the source file in the right folder.  The source file names are longish alphanumerical strings so this process is tedious.  In order to make it less tedious I would like to creaty symlinks to the orignal source files and save them side by side with the .png files. The output folder would then look like this
Output files:
\\drive\dest\out1.png
\\drive\dest\out1_src.txt
\\drive\dest\out2.png
\\drive\dest\out2_src.txt
\\drive\dest\out3.png
\\drive\dest\out3_src.txt
where \\drive\dest\out1_src.txt is a symlink to \\drive\src1\src1.txt, etc.
I am attempting to accomplish this via
os.symlink('//drive/dest/out1_src.txt', '//drive/src1/src1.txt')
However no matter what I try I get

PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied

I have tried running the script from an elevated shell, enabling Developer Mode, and running
fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2R:1
fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1
but nothing seems to work.  There is absolutely no problem creating the symlinks on a local drive, e.g.,
os.symlink('C:/dest/out1_src.txt', '//drive/src1/src1.txt')
but that does not accomplish my goals.  I have also tried creading links on the local drive per above then then copying them to the network location with
shutil.copy(src, dest, follow_symlinks = False)
and it fails with the same error message.  Attempts to accomplish the same thing directly in the shell from an elevated shell also fail with the same ""Access is denied"" error message
mklink \\drive\dest\out1_src.txt \\drive\src1\src1.txt
It seems to be some type of a windows permission error.  However when I run fsutil behavior query SymlinkEvaluation in the shell I get

How to check how much RAM you have left:
on Linux, you can run free -mh in the terminal.
How to check how much memory a variable takes:
The function sys.getsizeof tells you memory size in bytes.
You haven't said what data type your arrays have, but, say, if they're float64, that's 8 bytes per element, so your array of 8 * 3 * 480 * 364 = 4193280 elements should only take up 4193280 * 8 bytes = about 30 Mb. So, unless you have very little RAM left, you probably shouldn't be running out of memory.
So, I'd first check your assumptions: does your list really only have 8 elements, do all the elements have the same shape of (3, 480, 364), what is the data type, do you create this array once or a thousand times? You can also check the size of a list element: sys.getsizeof(list[0]).
Most likely this will clear it up, but what if your array is really just too big for your RAM?
What to do if an array doesn't fit in memory
One solution is to use smaller data type (dtype=np.float32 for floating point, np.int32 or even np.uint8 for small integer numbers). This will sacrifice some precision for floating point calculations.
If almost all elements in the array are zero, consider using a sparse matrix.

68,"I have a data science project in Python and I wonder how to manage my data. Some details about my situation:

My data consists of a somewhat larger number of football matches, currently around 300000, and it is supposed to grow further as time goes on. Attached to each match are a few tables with different numbers of rows/columns (but similar column formats across different matches).
Now obviously I need to iterate through this set of matches to do some computations. So while I don’t think that I can hold the whole database in memory, I guess it would make sense to have at least chunks in memory, do computations on that chunk, and release it.
At the moment I have split everything up into single matches, gave each match an ID and created a folder for each match with the ID as folder name. Then I put the corresponding tables as small individual csv files into the folder that belongs to a given match. Additionally, I have an „overview“ DataFrame with some „metadata“ columns, one row per match. I put this row as a small json into each match folder for convenience as well.
I guess there would also be other ways to split the whole data set into chunks than match-wise, but for prototyping/testing my code with a small number of matches, it actually turned out to be quite handy to be able to go to a specific match folder in a file manager and look at one of these tables in a spreadsheet program (although similar inspections could obviously also be made from code in appropriate settings). But now I am at the point where this huge number of quite small files/folders slows down the OS so much that I need to do something else.
Just to be able to deal with the data at all right now, I simply created an additional layer of folder hierarchy like „range-0“ contains folders 0-9999, „range-1“ contains 10000-19999 etc. But I‘m not sure if this is the way to go forward.
Maybe I could simply save one chunk - whatever one chunk is - as a json file, but would lose some of the ease of the manual inspection.
At least everything is small enough, so that I can do my statistical analyses on a single machine, such that I think I can avoid map/reduce-type algorithms.
On another note, I have close to zero knowledge about database frameworks (I have written a few lines of SQL in my life), and I guess I would be the only person making requests to my database, so I am in doubt that this makes sense. But in case it does, what are the advantages of such an approach?

Since you don't give more specific details of the specific files and data you are dealing with, we can't suggest specific arrangements. If the data is proper to be arranged in an SQL tabular representation, you could get benefits from putting all of it in a database and use some ORM - you'd also have to write adapters to get the Python object data into Pandas for your numeric analysis if you that, and it might end up being a superfluous layer if you are already getting it to work.
So, just be sure that whatever adaptations you do to get the files easier to deal with by hand (like the extra layer of folders you mention), don't get in the way of your code - i.e., make your code so that it automatically find its way across this, or any extra layers you happen to create (this can be as simple as having the final game match folder full path as a column in your ""overview"" dataframe)",0.4082,0.30276757,0.0111082540825009,0.10543243000000002,269,614

You can think it is possible to patch CPython itself. Well it is not correct too as I guess. A lot of shared libraries use C/C++ code as CPython itself. Tensorflow, for example.
Going further, I guess it is possible to do following things:

patch the compiler which compiles C/C++ code for CPython/modules, which is hard I guess.
just use an usual profiler, and trace which files, directories and calls are used by python itself for operation, and whitelist them, due they are needed, which is the best option by my opinion (AppArmor for example).
maybe you can be interested in the patching of CPython itself, where it is possible to hook needed functions and calls to external C libraries, but it can be annoying due you will have to revise every added library to your project, and also C code is often used for performance (e.g. json module), which doesn't open too much things.",0.6122,0.32344067,0.083407886326313,0.28875933,307,129

You have a unique value tied to the data (for instance if they are provided in sequence then you can create a sequence number) then you can simply use the unique value as nonce and then use AES encryption in counter mode. Counter mode doesn't expand the data but it is insecure if no nonce is supplied. Note that you do need the nonce when decrypting.

You use format preserving encryption or FPE such as FF1 and FF3 defined by NIST. There are a few problems with this approach:

there are issues with these algorithms if the amount of input data is minimal (as it seems to be in your case);
the implementations of FF1 and FF3 are generally hard to find;
if you have two unique bit values then they will result in identical ciphertext.

I am just looking to encrypt a piece of code from point A, send it to point B, have it decrypted at point B and run there locally using either AES or RSA. It can be sent by any means, as long as the code itself is encrypted and unreadable.","Yes this is very possible but would require some setup to work.
First off Base64 is an encoder for encoding data from binary/bytes to a restricted ascii/utf subset for transmission usually over http. Its not really an obfuscator, more like a packager for binary data.
So here is what is needed for this to work.

A pre-shared secret key that both point A and point B have. This key cannot be transmitted along with the code since anyone who gets the encrypted code would also get the key to decrypt it.

There would need to be an unencrypted code/program that allows you to insert that pre-shared key to use to decrypt the encrypted code that was sent. Can't hardcode the key into the decryptor since again anyone with the decryptor can now decrypt the code and also if the secrey key is leaked you would have to resend out the decryptor to use a different key.

Once its decrypted the ""decryptor"" could save that code to a file for you to run or run the code itself using console commands or if its a python program you can call eval or use importlib to import that code and call the function within.
WARNING: eval is known to be dangerous since it will execute whatever code it reads. If you use eval with code you dont trust it can download a virus or grab info from your computer or anything really. DO NOT RUN UNTRUSTED CODE.


Also there is a difference between AES and RSA. One is a symmetric cipher and the other is asymmetric.

First of all, I splitted dataset into 2 portions (80-10) for training (800 rows) and tesing (200rows) correspondingly. After that, I use Grid Search with CV = 10 to tune hyperparameter on training set with these 2 models (SVM and Random Forest). When hyperparameters are identified for each model, I use these hyperparameters of these 2 models to test Accuracy_score on training and testing set again in order to find out which model is the best one for my data (conditions: Accuracy_score on training set < Accuracy_score on testing set (not overfiting) and which Accuracy_score on testing set of model is higher, that model is the best model).
However, SVM shows the accuracy_score of training set is 100 and the accuracy_score of testing set is 83.56, this means SVM with tuning hyperparameters is overfitting. On the other hand, Random Forest shows the accuracy_score of training set is 72.36 and the accuracy_score of testing set is 81.23. It is clear that the accuracy_score of testing set of SVM is higher than the accuracy_score of testing set of Random Forest, but SVM is overfitting.

_ Is my method correst when I implement comparation of accuracy_score for training and testing set as above instead of using Cross-Validation? (if use Cross-Validation, how to do it?

Validation

Training is used to train the model, as you have been doing. The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of a model trained with a given set of hyperparameters.

You can then compare performance on the test set between your classifiers.

I have mixed up threads and processes in the question I asked. Since I have better clarity on the concept, I would rephrase question 2 as follows(for any future reference):
If the two additional processes run in parallel with two other processes in existing Cores, will GIL not stop their execution?
Ans: GIL does NOT affect the processes, GIL allows only one thread to run at a time, there is no restriction on processes, however. The system scheduler manages how the additional two processes will run on the existing cores.","First you are mixing up threads and processes: in Python only threads not processes have to share a lock on their interpreter.
If your are using the multiprocessing library then, your are using Python processes which have their own interpreter.
When you are using Python processes, their execution is managed by your operating system scheduler, in the same manner as every other processes in your computer.
If you have more processes than CPU cores then the extra processes are waiting in background to be scheduled.
This usually happen when an other process terminates, wait on an IO, or periodically with clock interrupts.",0.8163,0.24039161,0.3317010700702667,0.57590839,122,194

I have been looking here for my sample code, but I don't find it.  I'll edit my post if I get a working solution.
The basic idea is to calculate all the derivatives of the function exp(-(x*x)) and use the coeficients to derive the integral form (by dividing those coeficients by one more than the exponent of x of the above function) to get the taylor series of the integral (I recommend you to use the unnormalized version described above to get the simple number coeficients, then adjust the result by multiplying by the proper constants)  you'll get a taylor series with good convergence, giving you precise values for full precision (The integral requires a lot of subdivision, and you cannot divide an unbounded interval into a finite number of intervals, all finite)

Because you know sometimes going from directly 1 to 3 is slower than 1-2-3. (visiting 2 which is not necessary but make it for shortcut)
I defined a dummy depot which cost 0 , I used this for end because if you use starts you have to define ends. And I put ends 000 which are basically ending position. You might ask why you didnt put your ""JOB"" locations. But this means they have to end there. So it doesn't seem optimal because  example one vehicle could be really near to both of ""JOB"" locations but if it terminates / ends because it has END defined vehicle would stop.
I have no idea how to make this work. Basically what I want that if certain locations are visited once just terminate - that's the solution. So if jobs are (1,3,5) and  Vehicle 1  visited 1,3 and Vehicle 2 just visited 2 it should be finished.
If I use solver in ortools It will be like TSP problem which will try to visit each location in distance_matrix. I don't exactly want this.

TWS requires a daily logout or restart. I've opted for the daily restart at a set time so I could easily anticipate a restart of my application at certain times (at least, so I thought.)

Well, without knowing how you node servers are setup, its hard to say if socket.io would be a good fit, this is simply because socket.io uses WSS to connect, so unless you are running it from the browser it will need additional configurations / modules setup on the server to actually use WSS (if you do go this route, you will need socket.io-client module on each system, this is important because this will allow you to connect to the socket.io server, also make sure the version of socket.io matches the socket.io-client build)

You actually need logits (output of sigmoid) for loss calculation so it is a correct design to not have it as part of forward pass. More over for predictions you don't need logits because argmax(linear(x)) == argmax(softmax(linear(x)) i.e softmax does not change the ordering but only change the magnitudes (squashing function which converts arbitrary value into [0,1] range, but preserves the partial ordering]
If you want to use activation functions to add some sort of non-linearity you normally do that by using a multi-layer NN and having the activation functions in the last but other layers.
Finally, if you are using other loss function like NLLLoss, PoissonNLLLoss, BCELoss then you have to calculates sigmoid yourself.

Consider a chemical process flow where you convert materials (a,b) with attributes such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc. into a final product c. To get there, I need unit operations D,E,F... each with its own set of attributes (cost, size, etc.). I would only need information flow in one direction as closed loops will probably increase the complexity (if not, I would really appreciate insight into how closed loops would work).
a,b --> D --> E --> F --> c
Ultimately I would like to be able to do a system cost analysis, where I would sum up the cost attributes of D,E,F.
My current thought process to approach this is to define a ""materials"" object, then have D inherit materials, E inherit D... c inherit F then lastly a ""system"" object inherit c to analyze the system variables. Since I would like to be able to swap out D,E,F for say G,H,I, there also needs to be code for conditional inheritance where D must be able to accept inputs a,b (based on defined attributes) and E be able to inherit D for the same reason. One of the things I'm unsure of is how object c would be able to understand how to sum up attributes of all the inherited objects (probably based on some consistent naming convention of objects/attributes?).

ExternalProperties for temperature/pressure, etc.
Material which contains the Material_Type and various properties/functions aimed at transforming the material type so for instance it could contain a transform function with an unbounded list of ExternalProperties

In S3's case, you can use bucket versioning which might prove helpful. Then setup some sort of trigger. You can definitely get creative here, and I've thought about this a lot. In practice, the best options I've tried are:

Set up an endpoint that when called will go open the new model at whatever location you store it at. Set up a webhook on the storage/S3 bucket that will send a quick automated call to the given endpoint and auto-load that new item
Same thing as #1, but instead you just manually load it. In both cases you'll really want some security on that endpoint or anyone that finds your site can just absolutely abuse your stack.
Set a timer at startup that calls a given function nightly, internally running within the application itself. The function is invoked and then goes and reloads.

16,"I am currently starting a kind of larger project in python and I am unsure about how to best structure it. Or to put it in different terms, how to build it in the most ""pythonic"" way. Let me try to explain the main functionality:
It is supposed to be a tool or toolset by which to extract data from different sources, at the moment mainly SQL-databases, in the future maybe also data from files stored on some network locations. It will probably consist of three main parts:

A data model which will hold all the data extracted from files / SQL. This will be some combination of classes / instances thereof. No big deal here

One or more scripts, which will control everything (Should the data be displayed? Outputted in another file? Which data exactly needs to be fetched? etc) Also pretty straightforward

And some module/class (or multiple modules) which will handle the data extraction of data. This is where I struggle mainly


So for the actual questions:

Should I place the classes of the data model and the ""extractor"" into one folder/package and access them from outside the package via my ""control script""? Or should I place everything together?

How should I build the ""extractor""? I already tried three different approaches for a SqlReader module/class: I tried making it just a simple module, not a class, but I didn't really find a clean way on how and where to initialize it. (Sql-connection needs to be set up) I tried making it a class and creating one instance, but then I need to pass around this instance into the different classes of the data model, because each needs to be able to extract data. And I tried making it a static class (defining
everything as a@classmethod) but again, I didn't like setting it up and it also kind of felt wrong.

Should the main script ""know"" about the extractor-module? Or should it just interact with the data model itself? If not, again the question, where, when and how to initialize the SqlReader

And last but not least, how do I make sure, I close the SQL-connection whenever my script ends? Meaning, even if it ends through an error. I am using cx_oracle by the way


I am happy about any hints / suggestions / answers etc. :)","For this project you will need the basic Data Science Toolkit: Pandas, Matplotlib, and maybe numpy. Also you will need SQLite3(built-in) or another SQL module to work with the databases.
Pandas: Used to extract, manipulate, analyze data.

Numpy: Build fast, stable arrays of data that work much faster than python's lists.

As security, game encryption isn't a fight worth picking. You have to decrypt the files to run them and that will always be a weak point to exploit.

36,"I'm lost with Python. After troubleshooting with a friend through Discord for literally months I am about to give up. This is my last attempt at trying to get Python fixed on my Windows 10 laptop.
I'm using a Lenovo Legion 5, bought the laptop in November 2020. I've not been able to get anything related to Python to run in the CMD window. I can run Python no problem, but nothing I have installed through pip has ever worked. I can use virtualenvs, but only through PyCharm for example. Python has never really worked through the command line.
Yes I tried reopening the CMD window, rebooted the system many times, ran the CMD as administrator, installed the path variables for both Python and esptool.py but nothing seems to help.
I honestly don't know where to start because none of the 250+ websites I've visited to so far that suggested a fix for any kind of issue I've been experiencing with Python has been working. I can run Python fine by the way, just none of the things installed through pip will work.
Let's start with a use-case:
I'm trying to run esptool.py so installed it with pip install esptool. This install worked fine, and I can confirm it is installed with pip show -f esptool.
However, when running esptool.py version it told me:
'esptool.py' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
So I added the local folder from the previous step to the %PATH% variables, after running esptool.py version it gave me a popup asking me with what kind of program I should open this, I didn't select to open with this kind of program from now on. This makes it so that I do not get an error, what now happens is that another window quickly opens and then exits without an error code. So I have no clue what's happening.
What should happen is that it should tell me which version is installed in the CMD window.
There have been a few other things going on with my Windows 10 install, for one, the username that I used during the installation wasn't used to create the user directory. Windows 10 somehow instead chose a name that was related to the first 5 characters of my email address, which is totally strange as I haven't used that string in the installation of Windows 10 at all. This was a fresh install on a new laptop.
Now, after an update of Win10 my user icon doesn't display anymore and I had to change ownership of the 'Windows Apps' folder in order to be able to access it. Changing the ownership also changed the name I now see on the login screen when I boot up the laptop. It changed from the 5 first chars of my email address to my full name in the login screen, only because I took ownership of this folder so I could access it.
There have been a lot of things going on that I think should not be changing all the time, things to do with administrator rights, ownership, etc.
Now, since opening esptool.py doesn't open it, but also doesn't show me an error, I'm clueless and the only thing I can think of is doing a fresh system install, but I have a bunch of projects going on for which I need this laptop in working order and I don't have the mental health (due to corona) left to do a fresh system install. I'm worn down. Not in a dramatic way, I just don't have the spare energy to go through the whole process. So I'm hoping someone can point me in the right way to troubleshoot why my Python doesn't want to work natively.
What happens when running esptool.py version is that I can see it opens a Python window, but without showing any content it closes within a few milliseconds.
What is going on, how do I continue? I hope someone knows how to troubleshoot my system, to find the core of the problem.","It apparently was rather simple. First of all, thanks for the replies! And second of all, thanks for pointing me to superuser.com I wasn't aware of the site and will continue there.
The fix was to use python -m pip install esptool as suggested by Valentin Kuhn.
To answer AKD, I have a lot of experience with programming on my MacBook, but I'm not experienced with actually maintaining the system side, I'm a creative user. It's just that ever since I got a Windows laptop it's been nothing but trouble and after months of chatting about each individual issue with people on Discord nobody has been able to find a solution. I'm not expecting a GUI, just a simple ""esptool.py v3.0"" was the answer I was expecting from the command line.

43,"I am using Python to automate some installations in my everyday workflow.
The installation requires mounting a .dmg file to the system in order to start and complete the installation. Everything works fine until I try to eject/unmount the attached volume, it gives an error that the volume is used by Python and cannot be ejected/unmounted. The installation process is already completed by the time the unmount is executed, so in theory, files should no longer be in use.
Force unmount helps with the unmount process, but for some reason, it interferes with subsequent subprocess.Popen command that starts the installed application and the app crashes at startup. The crash doesn't occur if the volume is not unmounted, which is a sign the issue is caused by the unmount process.

44,"I have a problem: we are using a package that is not maintained for a while now. So we forked it in order to maintain it ourselves. The package already exists lets say it is named package_a. Most of the code and the __init__ are in the package_a/ folder.
Now we want to make our own package that will include our maintained code and we want to name is package_b. So far so good but the problems is that package_b wants to have the code and the __init__ in package_b/ folder and github changes the contributions for all files when a folder is renamed. And I would like that credit for contributions stays where it is due, the 10k+ lines of code didn't just appear in my local repo out of thin air. Any suggestions how we can have package named package_b but keep the code in the original folder package_a/?
I am thinking along the lines of trying with some clever way of importing package_a into package_b or something along the line but I hope for a definite answer.","Instead of copying the code or trying to import A into B, extract the common code into a 3rd package which both A and B import. Or perhaps a subclass. This doesn't solve your contribution problem, but it does avoid making a big maintenance hassle by copying and pasting 10,000 lines of code.

Git doesn't record copies and renames, but it can recognize when they happen. To give Git the best chance of recognizing a copy, do only the copy in its own commit. Make no changes to the content. Then in a second commit make any necessary changes to the copied code.
In normal Git you can nudge git log and git blame to honor copies and renames with -C. Git doesn't do this by default because it's more expensive.
Github will do what Github will do.
Regardless of who Github says who wrote what line their contributions will still be in the project history. That's how it goes. You make your contribution and then others put their own work on top of it. This is normal. Their contributions remain in the history.
""History sheer"" is also normal, that's when a change touches many lines but is otherwise insignificant. For example, if you were to restyle the code that would cause a history sheer. git blame will say that was the last commit to touch the code. git blame -w mitigates this somewhat, and Github has an ""ignore whitespace"" option. History sheer is normal and so is learning to skip over it.

I have a google sheet, who's data I need to process on my local system. The nature of processing is very tedious and long so I wrote a script for it.
Problem
I need to access the google sheet through the python script to process it further. Online it is mentioned that to read the private google sheet directly, I need to create a GCP project and within that project, I need to create a service account. After that I should download the credentials and share the google sheet with that service account email.
Two problems here are :

Downloading the credentials -- insecure and my organization prohibits it.
Sharing of google sheet with service account email. organization also prohibits sharing sheet with outside organization emails.

What I found as a solution
I came across a solution of impersonating a service account but I could not find anything as to how can I do that. (Would appreciate any insights on that). All the other solutions suggested to download credentials which is a big NO.
For the sharing of sheets thing, I guess we can use drive API, but same problems are with that.

Request had insufficient authentication scopes."". Details: ""Insufficient Permission: Request had insufficient authentication scopes.

using ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets',  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'] as scopes
What I need? (Summary)
How to access google sheets API (or download the Sheet from google drive) without downloading any sort of credentials.json.","problem
Your only option to access private user data is to be authorized as a user who can access the file. Either logging in using Oauth2 or using a service account

Downloading the credentials -- insecure and my organization prohibits it.

In order to use a google api you must first register your application on google developer console and download the client credentials then a user must authorize the application using Oauth2, which would mean both downloading the credentials.json file from google developer console and you getting user token credentials from the authorized user.

Sharing of google sheet with service account email. organization also prohibits sharing sheet with outside organization emails.

In order to use a service account you would again need to first register your application on google developer console and download the client credentials for the service account.  Then you would need to share the sheet with the service account.
service account impersonation.
Service account impersonation is used by GSuite domain. You create a normal service account again downloading the credentials, and then the GSuite admin is able to delegate authority to the service account which will allow it to impersonate a user on the domain.
This would require you to have GSuite domain and the owner of the file being also on the GSuite domain, and you creating a project on google developer console and downloading the credentials.json for the service account, which you already stated you couldn't do.

Use a cluster that's sized well for your data (running an analysis on 2GB of data requires different amounts of memory than 2TB)
split data into multiple files so it's easier to process in parallel

If you are fetching 1 row, and you have an index (esp, the PRIMARY KEY) to locate that one row, I would expect it to be even faster than 15ms.

I am now heading towards the second part where I need be be able to send the data I need using protobuf to the clients computer where they will receive and display on their own client.
The customer has provided examples of their GRPC servers, and it's written in C#.
Currently, for security reasons, our system uses RedHat 8.3 and I am using a SSH Protocol Library called Paramiko for the SSH part. Paramiko is a Python library. Also the machine I am extracting data from only runs on Linux.

Here are my main questions, and I apologize if I got nowhere.
1.) The developer from the client side provided us with a VM that has a simulator and examples written in C# since their side was written in C#. He says that it's best to use the C# because all examples can be almost re-used as it's all written, etc. While I know it's possible to use C# in Linux these days, I've still have no experience doing so I don't know how complicated/tedious this can get.
2.) I write code in C# and wrap all the python code, which is also something I've never done, but I would be doing this all in RedHat.
3.) I keep it in python because sending protobuf messages works across languages as long as it is sent properly. Also from the client side, I'm not sure if they will need to make adjustments if receiving protobuf messages written in Python(I don't think this is the case because it's just serialized messages, yea?).
Any advice would be appreciated. I am looking to seek more knowledge outside my realm.

I guess a usb2can device with the CANopen Python library can do the work. But I just don't know how to establish communication between the usb2can device and the battery. It would be helpful with any insights in framing the packets.","This is what you need to do:

Get the necessary tools for CAN bus development. This means some manner of CAN listener in addition to your own application. It also means cables + terminating resistors. The easiest is to use DB9 dsub connectors. An oscilloscope is also highly recommended.
Read the documentation about the device to figure out how to set node id and baudrate, or at least which default settings it uses.
Find out which Device Profile the device uses, if any. The most common one is CiA 401 ""generic I/O module"". In which case the default settings will be node id 1, baudrate 125kbps.
Your application will need to act as NMT Master - network managing master - on this bus. That is, the node responsible for keeping track of all other nodes.
If the device is CANopen compliant and you've established which baudrate and node id it uses, you'll get a ""NMT bootup"" message at power up. Likely from node 1 unless you've changed the node id of the device.
You'll need to send a ""NMT start remote node"" message to the device to bring it from pre-operational to operational.
Depending on what Device Profile the device uses, it may now respond with sending out all its enabled PDO data once, typically with everything set to zero.
Now check the documentation of the device to find out which data that resides in which PDO. You'll need to match TPDO from the device with RPDO in your application and vice versa. They need to have the same COBID - CAN identifiers, but also the same size etc.
COBID is set in PDO communication settings in the Object Dictionary. If you need to change settings of the device, it needs to be done with SDO access of the device Object Dictionary.
More advanced options involve PDO mapping, where you can decide which parts of the data you are interested in that goes into which PDO. Not all devices support dynamic PDO mapping - it might use static PDO mapping in which case you can't change where the data comes out.
Other misc useful stuff is the SAVE/LOAD features of CANopen in case the device supports them. Then you can store your configuration permanently so that your application doesn't need to send SDOs at start-up for configuration every time the system is used.
Heartbeat might be useful to enable to ensure that the device is up and running on regular basis. Your application will then act as Heartbeat consumer.",0.4082,0.69216114,0.0806547850370407,0.28396113999999995,529,205

21,"I am developing a virtual stock market application on django and came upon the following problem. In any stock market application, there is an option of limit buy, stop loss and target sell. This essentially means to buy a share if it ever touches a price which is lower than the current price, to sell a share if it touches a very low price and to sell a share if it touches a high price respectively. For this, the server needs to constantly monitor the live data coming in from the API of a particular stock and perform the action if it happens.

I can use a simple script and connect to the Letsencrypt API to generate and request certs once domains are pointed to my server(s). The problem I am running into is that once the domain is pointed, how do I know? Dokku doesn't connect all incoming requests to my container and therefore Flask wouldn't be able to detect it unless I manually connect it with the dokku domains:add command?

So I'm not sure why you need a cert per customer, but let's say you are going to do

The alternative is a customer prefix.
Say your app URL looks like www.myapp.com/api/v1/somecomand
you could use www.myapp.com/api/v1/customerID/somecommand and then allow your load balancer to route based on the prefix and use a rewrite rule to remove the customerID back to the original URL.
This is more complicated, and it is load balancer dependent but so is the first solution.

Is there a way to create a hex value between 0x20 and 0x7E with 5 volts? Is there a cheap component on the market or circuit logic that can achieve this?
I'm not sure what the proper terminology for this is, but here's what I'm trying to do:
I have a bluetooth module connected to my pico via UART0 TX and UART0 RX. The use for this is a bit long to explain, but essentially, I want the bluetooth module to work without my pico attached to it. I have a device that outputs a signal, the pico reads the signal, then it tells the bluetooth module to transmit to the receiver. However, since the data to transmit isn't actually important, it makes sense to cut out the pico and simply have the bluetooth module read the signal directly then transmit.
I have the device that outputs exactly when I want, but it outputs the equivalent of 00 in hex. My computer is connected via bluetooth and can read it just fine. However, the pico, reading the input through RX, can't. I've found no way for micropython using UART to read 00 - UART.any() and UART.read() want a character, and 00 only corresponds to NULL.
So essentially, I need some way to transmit a hex value between 0x20 and 0x7E without using the raspberry pi pico. Is there some kind of component that is able to do this? In practice, the bluetooth module will be connected to 5V power with up to 5 amps.

Fortunately, there is a conceptually limited number of ways people can intentionally change the input word in order to obtain a new word that resembles the initial one enough to be understood by other people. For example, bad actors could try to:

duplicate some letters multiple times
add some separators (e.g. ""-"", ""."") between characters
delete some characters (e.g. the f word without ""c"")
reverse the word
potentially others

My suggestion is to initially keep it simple, if you don't want to delve into machine learning. As a possible approach you could try to:

manually create a set of lower-case bad words with their duplicated letters removed (e.g. ""killer"" -> ""kiler"").

manually/automatically add to this set variants of these words with one or multiple letters missing that can still be easily understood (e.g. ""kiler"" +-> ""kilr"").

extract the words in the message (e.g. by message_str.split())

for each word and its reversed version:
a. remove possible separators (e.g. ""-"", ""."")
b. convert it to lower case and remove consecutive, duplicate letters
c. check if this new form of the word is present in the set, if so, censor it or the entire message


This solution lacks the protection against words with characters separated by one or multiple white spaces / newlines (e.g. ""killer"" -> ""k i l l e r"").
Depending on how long the messages are (I believe they are generally short in  chat rooms), you can try to consider each substring of the initial message with removed whitespaces, instead of each word detected by the white space separator in step 3.

43,"We have an existing python application (let's call it control app) that does operation data logging as well as smaller controlling tasks on a machine. We want to extend this application with a web interface, which is based on flask (let's call it web app). Both parts, the control app as well as the web app, are already present, however, the setup feels somehow fishy. In the process of rethinking the setup, I'm somehow undecided on how to structure those two parts.
At the moment, the control app gathers machine data and stores it in a postgres database. Based on several machine states, additional operations are performed that provide new input for the PLCs that control the machine.
The web app currently polls the database to react to machine states to e.g. update visualisation data, change some (state representing) images and such things.
The web app polling the database is the part that somehow smells. So my idea was to unify both apps into one to have the web app tightly coupled to the control app to be able to react on machine state changes instead of polling the database for those state changes.
Based on that idea, I'm wondering how to add a flask app to an existing python app. When I'm not mistaken, the flask app consumes the application's main thread, which would break to already existing logic. Thus I would need to have one of the two parts running on another thread. Thinking about this problem, I'm further wondering whether this merging is a good idea at all.
So, the questions are: Is it a good idea to merge both applications? If yes, how to merge them without breaking one of them? If not, how else should I try to get rid of the database polling (how to synchronize and also move some data from the web app to the control app)?","It's not a good idea to merge them per se -- problems in one part will affect the other, and this sort of tight coupling is a bad idea both because you can't run the two parts of the program on separate machines and because if one crashes, so does the other one.

63,"I am trying to introduce dynamic workflows into my landscape that involves multiple steps of different model inference where the output from one model gets fed into another model.Currently we have few Celery workers spread across hosts to manage the inference chain.

If someone is looking to see how this was accomplished, here are few things I did to get it working.

Change the airflow.cfg to change the executor,queue and result back-end settings (Obvious)
If we have to use Celery worker spawned outside the airflow umbrella, change the celery_app_name setting to celery.execute instead of airflow.executors.celery_execute and change the Executor to ""LocalExecutor"". I have not tested this, but it may even be possible to avoid switching to celery executor by registering airflow's Task in the project's celery App.
Each task will now call send_task(), the AsynResult object returned is then stored in either Xcom(implicitly or explicitly) or in Redis(implicitly push to the queue) and the child task will then gather the Asyncresult ( it will be an implicit call to get the value from Xcom or Redis) and then call .get() to obtain the result from the previous step.

Note: It is not necessary to split the send_task() and .get() between two tasks of the DAG. By splitting them between parent and child, I was trying to take advantage of the lag between tasks. But in my case, the celery execution of tasks completed faster than airflow's inherent latency in scheduling dependent tasks.",0.0,0.38076937,0.1449853181838989,0.38076937,317,224

this is what you would normally do - just fetch data variables(fetch a variable at a time) for each command, this would keep the bot simple and minimize unused recources.

In this one, whenever the user uses a command for the first time, it fetches the entire config table and stores it in a loaded dict from which you can access the config from. you can also update the config in the dict and every 30m-1hr it will log the values in the table and empty the dict.

You're basically creating a cached database in your application (the dictionary) and save a bunch of usually necessary data to access them quickly. It is what every (almost every) major service (like Steam) does in order to minimize the main database calls.
I think this is the better practice however it has its drawbacks.
First, from time to time, you have to compare the cached data with what you have in the original database because your bot will not have a single user and while the cached data is available to one user, another user might alter the data in the original database.
Second, it is harder to implement than the first approach. You need to determine which data to store, which data to update rapidly and also you need to implement an alarm system for the users to update their cache whenever the main data is altered in the database.

Therefore, I use no. of times each user purchase a certain item as implicit rating. However, in doing so, there could create bias between slow-moving products (such as Television) and fast-moving products (such as Chips, Snacks) since the no. of times customers would buy the slow-moving products are much less than fast-moving ones.
My questions are :

Is there anything better than no. of times a customer buys the certain items or visit counts to use as rating?
How do you add weight to help lessen the bias between slow-moving and fast-moving items.

Thank you for your answer in advanced!","Attempting to answer your specific questions:

Yes, but it depends on what other information you have about the items. I have tried to answer making some reasonable assumptions.

I can presume that you have the cost of the item. You can normalise by the cost of the item to ensure some reduction (not complete removal) of bias. You can do a direct normalisation (weighted_rating = implicit_rating * cost per item). Here, the cost_per_item serve  the purpose of weights to reduce bias. Alternatively, you can experiment with groups of prices by binning or clustering the prices across all items to form groups of products, thereby giving you a  group_mean_price. This can then be used as weights.


If you know something else about the item (such as perishable/ consumable/ bulky) you can have more representative clusters. Thereafter, you can assign implicit_rating to each item. Now, you can normalise each implicit_rating by using an aggregate statistics for the group rating (say group_mean_implicit_rating). So, weighted_rating = implicit_rating/group_mean_implicit_rating",0.4082,0.19110215,0.047115534543991,0.21709785,244,165

I have to run some test/diagnostic Python script on a Windows system. Due to explicit requirement, the system has no default system-wide Python instance, but there are two different Python instances installed, used locally by applications running on the system.

I want to run %PYTHONPATH%\python.exe myscript.py where %PYTHONPATH% points to one of the installed Python instances, but install the required additional modules ""somewhere"" outside %PYTHONPATH% (preferrably, in the same directory where my script is installed) so that my script can use them.
As my script is a test tool, it should not modify the OS or installed software, so the Python installation under %PYTHONPATH% should not be changed in any way.
It is also expected that the installation can be fully automated, ie. the best way to install would be just have the modules in the same .zip file with my script which is unpacked onto the target path.
It is also important that the system has no Internet access, so I have to download required files on another machine and copy them to the target system.

obtain the zip file containing standard modules from the appropriate Python version distribution (in my case it was the file python38.zip, it is inside the main zip file downloadable from Python site)

Design a new Model for each authentication service and tie it via a foreign key & reverse relationship to your DannyUser instances.

I have real-time data stream coming to my object-oriented storage from user application (json files being stored into S3 storage in Amazon).

My issue is, that the real-time data stream can at the same time generate even few hundreds JSON files from user applications that I need to run trough my Python script and I don't know how to approach this the best way.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.","Serverless can actually be cheaper than using a server. It is much cheaper when there are periods of no activity because you don't need to pay for a server doing nothing.
The hardest part of your requirement is sending the response back to the user. If an object is uploaded to S3, there is no easy way to send back a response and it isn't even obvious who is the user that sent the file.
You could process the incoming file and then store a response back in a similarly-named object, and the client could then poll S3 for the response. That requires the upload to use a unique name that is somehow generated.
An alternative would be for the data to be sent to AWS API Gateway, which can trigger an AWS Lambda function and then directly return the response to the requester. No server required, automatic scaling.
If you wanted to use a server, then you'd need a way for the client to send a message to the server with a reference to the JSON object in S3 (or with the data itself). The server would need to be running a web server that can receive the request, perform the work and provide back the response.

98,"I am using locust to run load test. Specifically I am trying to use docker-compose and following the documentation at https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/running-locust-docker.html
I want to retrive test stats in CSV format per the directions in https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/retrieving-stats.html

Thanks!","You should only have to worry about running --headless --csv=example (as noted from the docs page you linked to) and such on the master. The workers don't need those as headless only applies to the master and they don't aggregate their own results. The CSVs generated by the master should contain all the results from all the workers. If you've tried this and you're not seeing all the data you're wanting, you may want to try adding --csv-full-history.

The files will be named example_stats.csv, example_failures.csv and example_history.csv (when using --csv=example). The first two files will contain the stats and failures for the whole test run, with a row for every stats entry (URL endpoint) and an aggregated row. The example_history.csv will get new rows with the current (10 seconds sliding window) stats appended during the whole test run. By default only the Aggregate row is appended regularly to the history stats, but if Locust is started with the --csv-full-history flag, a row for each stats entry (and the Aggregate) is appended every time the stats are written (once every 2 seconds by default).",0.4082,0.46454406,0.0031787920743227,0.056344059999999974,263,136
99,I'm  designing a UML class diagram for a Mastermind game and I'm having trouble figuring out how to make the attribute 'Name' unique and not changeable. I'm assuming that I do this by naming the 'Name' attribute private and show it in the class diagram as well. Any sort of help would be highly appreciated. Thanks,"As per Python you can only indicate private attributes by adding an underscore in front of the name. Language-wise this is not a language construct but a convention. UML does not care since it's language-agnostic. Model it as private (by showing the - in front of the name). If you are generating code from that UML model the code generator might create the underscore automatically.
In any case, if you create a model with UML and indicate something to be private then the coder for the language must take care. For a closed implementation you just need to train your coders.

3,"I am quite new to web application development (Django). However, I have a bit of experience in working with html, css, and  python.
I am developing an application where the user will upload documents as input and change the available parameters values and the application will generate a new document as a downloadable file. (Text editor: VS Code).
(To get an intuition, consider the online pdf resizing applications as an example).
I am building the application from scratch. The major issue is modifying the inputs and producing desired output.
My approach towards it is:

Create python scripts for the different major actions( As per our example case, create pdf_compression.py, merge_two_pdfs.py and so on).
Ask the user to upload the required documents. Store the docs uploaded (only temporarily) and use them for further operations (with assumption that default sqlite3 will be sufficient).
In the webpage, add a button or a link (e.g. ""Compress"", ""Merge"") and embed the python script created in step1 (paste the script or add a link to its file location). That will perform the specific task when the button is pressed and generate the output.
Download the generated document.

I have achieved till the step 2 in my task but am lost on how to achieve the ""3rd"" step. How should I proceed  ahead?
Any suggestions( with code examples) are highly appreciated. I am open to any different approach also.
Update
About the application
The application does not need to serve users globally like google. It will be hosted through a server locally( or though an institutions' local server) and users having access to the server will be accessing it.(in other words it does not need to be https://www... It only needs to be http://ip_address/url.)
Thanks in advance.","There's no need to embed your python scripts anywhere (or to use any javascript/AJAX, as some of the comments suggest).  The simplest way to do ""step 3"" is as follows:

When the ""Compress""/""Merge"" button (or link) is pressed, send a request to the server.  Typically you'd use the URL to indicate which action(s) to perform.

When the server receives the above request, generate the corresponding output file.  Any scripts that are installed on the server can be used to help make this file.  That said, I would recommend against writing separate scripts for each task.  Better would be to simply include the processing functions in your django application so the server can call them directly, without having to go through a command-line interface.  Or, if the functions would also be useful outside the context of a web server, they can be moved into their own general-purpose package.

Save the generated file to the database.  This isn't necessary if the server will always run on just one machine, but it's still a good idea if for no other reason than making your code more future-proof.

Create a URL that will serve the generated output file to the client.

Present the user with a download link to the aforementioned URL.


In short, do all the processing on the server.

You may already be aware of this, but one concern with sqlite is that it does not allow more than one process to access the database at a time (roughly speaking).  So if there's any possibility that two people will be using your website simultaneously, don't assume that sqlite will be sufficient.",0.4082,0.38224974,0.0006715113995596,0.025950260000000003,354,393

12,"I have two or three sets of Azure credentials for Work, Work Admin, and Personal.  This morning, I clicked the wrong login credential during an interactive login while doing some local development.  My local dev app now has an identity of me@company.com, when I need my identity to actually be me@admin.com.  Because I clicked the wrong identity, my application immediately starts getting obvious authorization errors.
My implementation is pretty naive right now, and I'm relying on the Python Azure SDK to realize when it needs to be logged in, and to perform that login without any explicit code on my end.

How can I get my local dev application to forget the identity that it has and prompt me to perform a new interactive login?
Things I've tried:

Turning the app off and back on again.  The credentials are cached somewhere, I gather, and rebooting the app is ineffective.
Scouring Azure docs.  I may not know the magic word, and as a consequence many search results have to do with authentication for users logging into my app, which isn't relevant.
az logout did not appear to change whatever cache my app is using for it's credential token.
Switching python virtual environments.  I thought perhaps the credential would be stored in a place specific to this instance of the azure-sdk library, but no dice.
Scouring the azure.identity python package.  I gather this package may be involved, but don't see how I can find and destroy the credential cache, or any out way to log out.

27,"In a real system, some sensor data will be dumped into specific directory as csv files. Then some data pipeline will populate these data to some database. Another pipeline will send these data to predict service.
I only have training and validation csv files as of now. I'm planning to simulate the flow to send data to predict service following way:
DAG1 - Every 2 min, select some files randomly from a specific path and update the timestamp of those files. Later, I may chose to add a random delay after the start node.
DAG2 - FileSensor pokes every 3 min. If it finds subset of files with modified timestamp, it should pass those to subsequent stages to eventually run the predict service.
It looks to me if I use FileSensor as-is, I can't achieve it. I'll have to derive from FileSensor class (say, MyDirSensor), check the timestamp of all the files - select the ones which are modified after the last successful poke and pass those forward.
Is my understanding correct? If yes, for last successful poke timestamp, can I store in some variable of MyDirSensor? Can I push/pull this data to/from xcom? What will be task-id in that case? Also, how to pass these list of files to the next task?
Is there any better approach (like different Sensor etc.) for this simulation? I'm running the whole flow on standalone machine currently. My airflow version is 1.10.15.","I am not sure if current Airflow approach is best for this use case actually. In the current incarnation Airflow is really all about working on ""data intervals"" - so basically each ""dag run"" is connected to some ""data interval"" and it should be processing data for that data interval. Classic Batch processing.
If I understand your case is more like a streaming (not entirely) but close. You get some (subset of) data which arrived since the last time and you process that data. This is not what (again current) version of Airflow - not even 2.1 is supposed to handle - because there is a complex manipulation of ""state"" which is not ""data interval"" related (and Airflow currently excels in the ""data interval"" case).
You can indeed do some custom operators to handle that. I think there is no ready-to-reuse pattern in Airflow for what you want to achieve, but Airflow is flexible enough that if you write your own operators you can certainly work around it and implement what you want. And writing operators in Airflow is super easy - it's a simple Python class with ""execute"" which can reuse existing Hooks to reach out to external services/storages and use XCom for communication between tasks. It's surprisingly easy to add a new operator doing even complex logic (and again - reusing hooks to make it easier to communicate with external services). For that, I think it's still worth to use Airflow for what you want to do.
How I would approach it - rather than modifying the timestamps of the files, I'd create other files - markers -  with the same names, different extensions and base my logic of processing on that (this way you can use the external storage as the ""state""). I think there will be no ready ""operators"" or ""sensors"" to help with it, but again - writing custom one is easy and should work.
However soon (several months) in Airflow 2.2 (and even more in 2.3) we are going to have some changes (mainly around flexible scheduling and decoupling dag runs from data intervals and finally to allow dynamic DAG with flaxible structure that can change per-run) that will provide some nice way of handling cases similar to yours.
Stay tuned - and for now rely on your own logic, but look out for simplifying that in the future when Airflow will be better suited for your case.
And in the meantime - do upgrade to Airflow 2. It's well worth it and Airflow 1.10 reached end of life in June, so the sooner you do, the better - as there will not be any more fixes to Airflow 1.10 (even critical security fixes)",0.4082,0.44092795,0.0010735237738117,0.032727950000000006,576,308

Can I get more detailed explanation for this?","Though I don't know the exact notations and equations, the answer has to do with the Big O Notation for the algorithms.
Big O notation is a way of expressing the theoretical worse time for an algorithm to complete over extremely large data sets. For example, a simple loop that goes over every item in a one dimensional array of size n has a O(n) run time - which is to say that it will always run at the proportional time per size of the array no matter what.
Say you have a 2 dimensional array of X,Y coords and you are going to loop across every potential combination of x/y locations, where x is size n and y is size m, your Big O would be O(mn)
and so on. Big O is used to compare the relative speed of different algorithms in abstraction, so that you can try to determine which one is better to use.
If you grab O(n) over the different potential sizes of n, you end up with a straight 45 degree line on your graph.
As you get into more complex algorithms you can end up with O(n^2) or O(log n) or even more complex. -- generally though most algorithms fall into either O(n), O(n^(some exponent)), O(log n) or O(sqrt(n)) - there are obviously others but generally most fall into this with some form of co-efficient in front or after that modifies where they are on the graph. If you graph each one of those curves you'll see which ones are better for extremely large data sets very quickly
It would entirely depend on how well your algorithm is coded, but it might look something like this: (don't trust me on this math, i tried to start doing it and then just googled it.)
Fitting a decision tree of depth ‘m’:

Naïve analysis: 2m-1 trees -> O(2m-1 n d log(n)).
each object appearing only once at a given depth: O(m n d log n)

and a Log n graph ... well pretty much doesn't change at all even with sufficiently large numbers of n, does it?
so it doesn't matter how big your data set is, these algorithms are very efficient in what they do, but also do not scale because of the nature of a log curve on a graph (the worst increase in performance for +1 n is at the very beginning, then it levels off with only extremely minor increases to time with more and more n)",0.0,0.19349831,0.0374415963888168,0.19349831,531,135

57,"I'm trying to fix leaks in a ctypes-based Python binding over a C library. I'm confused as to the behavior of memory management of strings and other pointers when working with ctypes.
There are, to my knowledge, 3 cases I need to solve, basically:
A) Creating memory in C and returning a c_char_p as the result of the function to the Python.
B) Creating a string in the Python, and passing it as a char const* parameter of a C function, and not freeing it in the C: this is the only one I've solved confidently: I can just do my_str.encode(""utf-8"") into a c_char_p, and the Python Alloc/GC handles both the allocation and deallocation.
C) Creating memory in Python, and storing it in the C (for example as a char* field within a struct), to be deallocated later (with a function from the C library).
My questions:
A)

is the c_char_p thus created a second pointer ? If so, what happens to the pointer allocated by the C ?
how do we free the pointer returned from the C ?
is there a difference of behavior between how c_void_p and c_char_p are handled as restype by the GC ?

C)

What is the correct way to ""give ownership"" of a memory pointer allocated in Python to the C ? .encode() clearly makes a Python object that's GC'ed.
is a string created by create_string_buffer also Python-GC'ed ?","This is an adaptation of the exchange I had on the Python discord server with someone who answered the questions:

is the c_char_p thus created a second pointer ? If so, what happens to the pointer allocated by the C ?

Yes, it is. The c_char_p is a PyObject* pointer that lives on the heap, and it stores the original C char* pointer inside it.

how do we free the pointer returned from the C ?

Pass the c_char_p to free() using ctypes

is there a difference of behavior between how c_void_p and c_char_p are handled as restype by the GC ?

No, in both cases, when the c_void_p or c_char_p is garbage collected, it does nothing, ie, it does not free the original C object that was pointed to.

What is the correct way to ""give ownership"" of a memory pointer allocated in Python to the C ?

That's not normally something you'd do - memory created by Python is usually freed by Python, memory created by C is usually freed by C. If you need to pass something from one domain to the other, it's best to copy it. It's possible to make the C side keep a Python reference to the Python object by using the Python C API, but that's probably not the best idea.

is a string created by create_string_buffer also Python-GC'ed ?

In this case, when the Python object is GC'd, it also frees the C memory. A c_char_p knows whether it owns the memory that it points to or doesn't, and when it's GC'd it frees the C memory if it owns it.
========
Since my (I = asker) goal is to have as few (no) reference to ctypes types for the Python end-user, given the answers above, I would do the following:

when I malloc a char* in the C in a function char* do_c_func(), I return it as a c_char_p restype in Python. In my Python, I have a wrapper function do_py_func() that calls do_c_func(), receives this c_char_p called my_c_char_p, and stores its contents in a Python string, through some sort of s = str(my_c_char_p). I then call ctypes.free(my_c_char_p): this frees the malloced char*, and the end of the function decrementing the last reference counter, this eventually garbage collects my_c_char_p.

I create a conversion function python_str_to_c_str(py_str) which takes a normal python string, and returns stdc.strdup(py_str.encode('utf-8')) (with stdc.strdup.restype = c_char_p), thereby providing a new char* to the C (which Python will recognize as having been created in the C). I use this conversion function anywhere I need to pass a string from the Python to the C. This makes it so the buffer created by my_string.encode('utf-8')), and the c_char_p returned by stdc.strdup, are both garbage-collected by the Python, but the char* itself is not.",0.0,0.27619937,0.0762860924005508,0.27619937,730,340

Odd behavior, because I expect Dymola to consistently set the working directory at .\Documents\Dymola at startup, unless told otherwise.
However, when I instantiate Dymola from its Python interface, at startup the working directory is set according to the setting Tools > Options > Settings > Save startup directory as follows:

Do not save - then when I instantiate Dymola, the current directory is set as the directory where the python environment is open. Possibly interesting here:

the directory where the python environment is open is not the directory where the function is located.

Example: in VSCode open folder > .\project, the function is in .\project\functions\dymIO\instantiateDymola.py, then the Dymola working directory at startup is set at .\project

When you start a program from Start-Menu the current directory is as default set to the installation directory of the program (in this case Dymola).

Not important: If the environment variable DYMOLAWORKDIRECTORY is not set it is set to .\Documents\Dymola
If the current directory is the same as the installation directory of Dymola then it sets current directory to .\Documents\Dymola - otherwise it keeps the current directory. This allows you to make a short-cut ""Start Dymola Here!""

Then you create a secondary index, where you have as key the lemmatised forms, and as values a list of forms that belong to the lemma.
When you do a lookup of a lemmatised word, eg go, you go to the secondary index to retrieve the inflected forms, go, goes, going, went; next you go to the inverted index and get all the locations for each of the inflected forms.
For ways of implementing this in an efficient manner, look at Witten/Moffat/Bell, Managing Gigabytes, which is a fantastic book on this topic.

Considering the sharing of data between users: I dont see a good way around having the users chose a login and associating the data with the user which is currently logged in. If its really just a for-fun project, you could use the User Agent and their IP address to identify users, but I dont recommend this - like, at all. This would be similar to browser-fingerprinting, which gives you a high chance of identifying users, but you can never be 100% sure.
What you could do for example is give the user a JWT, and just hand them out with a generated username. The user will be ""that user"" for as long as that JWT is valid.

7,"I have a time series in which i am trying to detect anomalies. The thing is that with those anomalies i want to have a range for which the data points should lie to avoid being the anomaly point. I am using the ML .Net algorithm to detect anomalies and I have done that part but how to get range?
If by some way I can get the range for the points in time series I can plot them and show that the points outside this range are anomalies.
I have tried to calculate the range using prediction interval calculation but that doesn't work for all the data points in the time series.
Like, assume I have 100 points, I take 100/4, i.e 25 as the sliding window to calculate the prediction interval for the next point, i.e 26th point but the problem then arises is that how to calculate the prediction interval for the first 25 points?","A method operating on a fixed-length sliding window generally needs that entire window to be filled, in order to make an output. In that case you must pad the input sequence in the beginning if you want to get predictions (and thus anomaly scores) for the first datapoints. It can be hard to make that padded data realistic, however, which can lead to poor predictions.
A nifty technique is to compute anomaly scores with two different models, one  going in the forward direction, the other in the reverse direction, to get scores everywhere. However now you must decide how to handle the ares where you have two sets of predictions - to use min/max/average anomaly score.
There are some models that can operate well on variable-length inputs, like sequence to sequence models made with Recurrent Neural Networks.",0.0,0.35252893,0.1242766454815864,0.35252893,168,180

Thank you!","Whether a REST service uses one or multiple cores depends on how you code it. You could, for instance, have a pool of python processes handling the requests.
Lets say that you have a python process. Since python grabs the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) when running byte code, even if it has multiple threads, only one will run at a time. If you have multiple python processes, each one has its own unique GIL, so these processes will run in parallel using multiple cores.

In most 3d imaging tasks, those coordinate spaces do not align.  So there is a transform to go from world space to 3d volume space.  But if all you have is a 3d numpy array, then there is no transformation information.
Update:
To index into the 3d volume take the X, Y, Z coordinates of your point from the STL object and convert them into integer value I, J, K.  Then lookup in the numpy array using I,J,K as indices: np_array[K][J][I].  I think you have to reverse the order of the indices because of the array ordering numpy uses.

53,"So I've been trying to attack this problem for a while but have no idea how to do it efficiently.
I'm given a substring of N (N >= 3) characters, and the substring contains solely of the characters 'A' and 'B'. I have to efficiently find a way to count all the substrings possible, which have only one A or only one B, with the same order given.
For example ABABA:
For three letters, the substrings would be: ABA, BAB, ABA. For this all three count because all three of them contain only one B or only one A.
For four letters, the substrings would be: ABAB, BABA. None of these count because they both don't have only one A or B.
For five letters: ABABA. This doesn't count because it doesn't have only one A or B.
If the string was bigger, then all substring combinations would be checked.
I need to implement this is O(n^2) or even O(nlogn) time, but the best I've been able to do was O(n^3) time, where I loop from 3 to the string's length for the length of the substrings, use a nested for loop to check each substring, then use indexOf and lastIndexOf and seeing for each substring if they match and don't equal -1 (meaning that there is only 1 of the character), for both A and B.
Any ideas how to implement O(n^2) or O(nlogn) time? Thanks!","Effeciently remove single letter substrings from a string

This is completely impossible. Removing a letter is O(n) time already. The right answer is to not remove anything anywhere. You don't need to.
The actual answer is to stop removing letters and making substrings. If you call substring you messed up.

Any ideas how to implement O(n^2) or O(nlogn) time? Thanks!

I have no clue. Also seems kinda silly. But, there's some good news: There's an O(n) algorithm available, why mess about with pointlessly inefficient algorithms?
charAt(i) is efficient. We can use that.
Here's your algorithm, in pseudocode because if I just write it for you, you wouldn't learn much:
First do the setup. It's a little bit complicated:

Maintain counters for # of times A and B occurs.
Maintain the position of the start of the current substring you're on. This starts at 0, obviously.
Start off the proceedings by looping from 0 to x (x = substring length), and update your A/B counters. So, if x is 3, and input is ABABA, you want to end with aCount = 2 and bCount = 1.

With that prepwork completed, let's run the algorithm:

Check for your current substring (that's the substring that starts at 0) if it 'works'. You do not need to run substring or do any string manipulation at all to know this. Just check your aCount and bCount variables. Is one of them precisely 1? Then this substring works. If not, it doesn't. Increment your answer counter by 1 if it works, don't do that if it doesn't.
Next, move to the next substring. To calculate this, first get the character at your current position (0). Then substract 1 from aCount or bCount depending on what's there. Then, fetch the char at 'the end' (.charAt(pos + x)) and add 1 to aCount or bCount depending on what's there. Your aCount and bCount vars now represent how many As respectively Bs are in the substring that starts at pos 1. And it only took 2 constant steps to update these vars.
... and loop. Keep looping until the end (pos + x) is at the end of the string.

This is O(n): Given, say, an input string of 1000 chars, and a substring check of 10, then the setup costs 10, and the central loop costs 990 loops. O(n) to the dot. .charAt is O(1), and you need two of them on every loop. Constant factors don't change big-O number.",0.8163,0.3874424,0.1839416176080703,0.4288576,602,336

A variable is too large when it becomes a problem. So, how can a variable become a problem? The big one is that the machien could possibly run out of memory, and an OOM killer (out-of-memory killer) or similiar will stop your program. How would you know if your variable is causing these issues? Pretty simple, your program crashes.
If the variable is static (with a size fully known at compile-time or prior to interpretation), you can calculate how much RAM it will take. (This is a bit finnicky with Python, so it might be easier to load it up at runtime and figure it out with a profiler.) If it's more than ~500 megabytes, you should be concerned. Over a gigabyte, and you'll probably want to reconsider your approach[^0]. So, what do you do then?
As suggested by @FishballNooodles, you can store your data line-by-line in a file and read the lines to an array. Unfortunately, the code they've provided still reads the entire thing into memory. If you use the code they're providing, you've got a few options, non-exhaustively listed below.

Consume a random number of newlines from the file when you need a line of text. You would look at one character at a time, compare it to \n, and read the line if you've encountered the requested number of newlines. This is O(n) worst case with respect to the number of lines in the file.

Rather than storing the text you need at a given index, store its location in a file. Then, you can seek to the location (which is probably O(1)), and read the text. This requires an O(n) construction cost at the start of the program, but would work much better at runtime.

Use an actual database. It's usually better not to reinvent the wheel. If you're just storing plain text, this is probably overkill, but don't discount it.

and also how to sign a challenge using the private key
so it'll be possible to verify it with the public key
Thanks","The Web Authentication protocol (and FIDO2 CTAP2 protocol built on top of it) have a challenge/response protocol against a device representing authentication of the user called an Authenticator.
The fido2 python library is meant to be used to talk to the authenticator, not to emulate an authenticator itself. The role that talks to the authenticator is called a Relying Party.
Systems typically further divide the Relying Party role into client and server roles - the client communicates with the authenticator, but really it is relaying the communication to and from the server. In WebAuthn, the browser, the site javascript it is running, and any underlying platform support are all considered part of the client. If you have native code talking USB or NFC to an authenticator (on platforms which let you), that native code is considered an authenticator.
The underlying authentication challenge does not have a cryptographic signature from the relying party. Instead, the cryptographic signature is made by the authenticator - the authenticator generates a new key pair on registration, and then supplies a signature from that key to prove possession and thus prove authentication. Since fido2 does not have authenticator support, it has no need to generate key pairs (outside of potential test code).
Note that this gets to an essential of the underlying WebAuthn and FIDO2 platform trust model - the user must trust the client. For this reason, several platforms have locked out low-level access to authenticator hardware (USB, NFC and BLE communication to hardware) and instead provide system API. Native applications must have entitlements to operate on behalf of a particular web origin as a WebAuthn client, and browsers must request special entitlements from the platform in order to represent all web domains.
This does not affect usage of fido2 for implementing server functionality, but I'd advise you to double-check platform support if you plan to use it to implement any client functionality.",-0.3571,0.3965118,0.5679953694343567,0.7536118,400,57

Run the lambda, have it read the first chunk of items from the database.
From the query you get a LastEvaluatedKey, store this in a separate dynamodb item/table
Put the LastEvaluatedKey to the queue
When the Lambda is invoked again, use the LastEvaluatedKey passed in from the queue and pass it to the ExclusiveStartKey  in your query, so that your query returns the next items from DynamoDB that you haven't processed yet

This setup means your lambda will only process small chunks at a time. It also means that when things go wrong, you have your item in DynamoDB with the LastEvaluatedKey stored, which allows you to continue from where you left off.

These usually run much slower and tend to be brittle because of the external resources.
That said, you have 2 options: unit test it, mocking the xls writing or integration test it, reading the xls file again after writing.
When you mock the xlswriter, you can have your mock check that it receives what should be written. This assumes that you don't want to test the actual xlswriter, which makes sense cause it's not your code, and you usually just test your own code. This makes for a fast test.
In the other scenario you could open the excel file with xslsreader and compare the written file to what is expected. This is probably best if you can avoid the file system and write the xls data to a memory buffer from which you can read again. If you can't do that, try using a tempdir for your test, but with that you're already getting into integration test land. This makes for a slower, more complicated, but also more thorough test.

Although I am quite new to docker and all its stuff, yet somehow managed to create an image (v2) and a container (cont) on my Win 11 laptop. And I have a demo.py which requires an .mp4 file as an arg.
Now, if I want to run the demo.py file, 1) I go to the project's folder (where demo.py lives), 2) open cmd and 3) run: docker start -i cont. This starts the container as:
root:834b2342e24c:/project#
Then, I should copy 4) my_video.mp4 from local project folder to container's project/data folder (with another cmd) as follows:
docker cp data/my_video.mp4 cont:project/data/.
Then I run:  5) python demo.py data/my_video.mp4. After a while, it makes two files: my_video_demo.mp4 and my_video.json in the data folder in the container. Similarly, I should copy them back to my local project folder: 6)
docker cp cont:project/data/my_video_demo.mp4 data/, docker cp cont:project/data/my_video_demo.json data/
Only then I can go to my local project/data folder and inspect the files.
I want to be able to just run a particular command that does 4) - 6) all in one.

Is it possible to do what I want? If everything is clear, I hope to get your support. Thank you.","Well, I think I've come up with a way of dealing with it.
I have learned that with -v one can create a place that is shared between the local host and the container. All you need to do is that run the docker and provide -v as follows:
docker run --gpus all -it -v C:/Workspace/project/data:/project/data v2:latest python demo.py data/my_video_demo.mp4
--gpus - GPU devices to add to the container ('all' to pass all GPUs);
-it - tells the docker that it should open an interactive container instance.
Note that every time you run this, it will create a new container because of -it flag.

Thank you :)","As I understand, you will have a lot of simultaneous call on a custom python code trigger by an orchestrator ($Universe) and you want it on GCP platform.
Like @al-dann, I would go to serverless approach in order to reduce the cost.
As I also understand, pub sub seems to be not necessary, you will could easily trigger the function from any HTTP call and will avoid Pub Sub.
PubSub is necessary only to have some guarantee (at least once processing), but you can have the same behaviour if the $Universe validate the http request for every call (look at http response code & body and retry if not match the expected result).
If you want to have exactly once processing, you will need more tooling, you are close to event streaming (that could be a good use case as I also understand). In that case in a full GCP, I will go to pub / sub & Dataflow that can guarantee exactly once, or Kafka & Kafka Streams or Flink.
If at least once processing is fine for you, I will go http version that will be simple to maintain I think. You will have 3 serverless options for that case :

App engine standard: scale to 0, pay for the cpu usage, can be more affordable than below function if the request is constrain to short period (few hours per day since the same hardware will process many request)
Cloud Function: you will pay per request(+ cpu, memory, network, ...) and don't have to think anything else than code but the code executed is constrain on a proprietary solution.

5,"Scenario: Lets say I have a REST API written in Python (using Flask maybe) that has a global variable stored. The API has two endpoints, one that reads the variable and returns it and the other one that writes it. Now, I have two clients that at the same time call both endpoints (one the read, one the write).
I know that in Python multiple threads will not actually run concurrently (due to the GIL), but there are some I/O operations that behave as asynchronously, would this scenario cause any conflict? And how does it behave, I'm assuming that the request that ""wins the race"" will hold the other request (is that right)?","In short: You should overthink your rest api design and implement some kind of fifo queue.
You have to endpoints (W for writing and R for reading). Lets say the global variable has some value V0 in the beginning. If the clients A reads from R while at the same time client B writes to W. Two things can happen.

The read request is faster. Client A will read V0.
The write request is faster. Client A will read V1.

You won't run into an inconsistent memory state due to the GIL you mentioned, but which of the cases from above happens, is completely unpredictable. One time the read request could be slightly faster and the other time the write request could be slightly faster. Much of the request handling is done in your operating system (e.g. address resolution or TCP connection management). Also the requests may traverse other machines like routers or switches in you network. All these things are completly out of your control and could delay the read request slightly more than the write request or the other way around. So it does not matter with how many threads you run your REST server, the return value is almost unpredictable.
If you really need ordered read write interaction, you can make the resource a fifo queue. So each time any client reads, it will pop the first element from the queue. Each time any client writes it will push that element to the end of the queue. If you do this, you are guaranteed to not lose any data due to overwriting and also you read the data in the same order that it is written.",0.4082,0.43453258,0.0006953401607461,0.026332579999999994,330,143

However, I'm quite confused as to how to properly install packages and set up the whole working environment. Unlike R where I suppose most people just use RStudio and directly install packages with install.packages(), there seems to be a variety of ways this can be done in python, including pip install conda install and there is also the issue of doing it in the command prompt or one of the IDEs. I've downloaded python 3.8.5 and anaconda3 and some of my most burning questions right now are:

When to use which command for installing packages? (and also should I always do it in the command prompt aka cmd on windows instead of inside jupyter notebook)
How to navigate the cmd syntax/coding (for example the python documentation for installing packages has this piece of code: py -m pip install ""SomeProject"" but I am completely unfamiliar with this syntax and how to use it - so in the long run do I also have to learn what goes on in the command prompt or does most of the operations occur in the IDE and I mostly don't have to touch the cmd?)
How to set up a working directory of sorts (like setwd() in R) such that my .ipynb files can be saved to other directories or even better if I can just directly start my IDE from another file destination?

I've tried looking at some online resources but they mostly deal with coding basics and the python language instead of these technical aspects of the set up, so I would greatly appreciate some advice on how to navigate and set up the python working environment in general. Thanks a lot!","Going over the technical differences of conda and pip:
So Conda is a packaging tool and installer that aims to do more than what pip does; handle library dependencies outside of the Python packages as well as the Python packages themselves. Both have many similar functionalities as well, you can install packages or create virtual environments with both.
It is generally advisable to generally have both conda and pip installed since there are some packages which might not be available with conda but with pip and vice versa.
The commands to install in both the ways is easy enough, but one thing to keep in mind is that

conda stores packages in the anaconda/pkgs directory
pip stores it in directory under /usr/local/bin/ for a Unix-based system, or \Program Files\ for Windows

You can use both pip or conda inside the jupyter notebook, it will work just fine, but it may be possible that you get multiple versions of the same package.
Most of the times, you will use cmd only to install a module used in your code, or to create environments, py -m pip install ""SomeProject"" here basically means that the module ""SomeProject"" will be downloaded in base env.",0.1361,0.3578028,0.0491723455488681,0.22170279999999998,257,360
14,"I'm working on a project where we are using vanilla javascript, Html and css for frontend while designing the backend in the FastAPI. The way backend connects with the frontend is using Templates, by adding the file name for a particular page and also sending the data as jinja template back to the client side. We have five pages and all are declared in the backend as get requests and we are using a specific html file for loading a particular page. So, there are mainly five html files for five pages

A hammer is a great tool if you need to pound in some nails, but it's a lousy tool for other purposes such as trying to use it as an eating utensil. So you'd be well advised, if you are going to use React and FastAPI, to use them as they were intended.
Jinja templates are used for server side rendering. But React is (in essence) also a server side rendering system. Both of them will not play nicely together, at least not without more work and complexity.
Instead you'd be better off committing to either the Jinja templating or React. If you choose Jinja, you figure out what the page will be (render) before sending it off to the client. If you choose React, you write the user-visible application, send that off to the client, and then the application on the client's browser fetches data through (usually JSON) APIs from the FastAPI back end.",0.0,0.41538912,0.1725481152534485,0.41538912,225,196

When I try to load the dataset using the API TabularDataset.to_pandas_dataframe(), it continues forever (hangs), if there are empty parquet files included in the Dataset. If the tabular dataset doesn't include those empty parquet files, TabularDataset.to_pandas_dataframe() completes within few minutes.
By empty parquet file, I mean that the if I read the individual parquet file using pandas (pd.read_parquet()), it results in an empty DF (df.empty == True).
I discovered the root cause while working on another issue mentioned [here][1].
My question is how can make TabularDataset.to_pandas_dataframe() work even when there are empty parquet files?
Update
The issue has been fixed in the following version:

30,"I am very new to python and I'd like to ask for an advice on how to, where to start, what to learn.
I've got this fantasy name generator (joining randomly picked letters), which every now and then creates a name which is acceptable, what I'd like to do though is to train an AI to generate names which aren't lets say just consonants, ultimately being able to generate human, elvish, dwarfish etc names.
I'd appreciate any advice in this matter.
Edit:
My idea is: I get a string of letters, if they resemble a name, I approve it, if not - reject. It creates a dataset of True/False values, which can be used in machine learning, at least that's what I am hoping for, as I said, I am new to programming.
Again, I don't mind learning, but where do I begin?","Single characters are not really a good fit for this, as there are combinatorial restrictions as to which letters can be combined to larger sequences. It is much easier to not have single letters, but instead move on to bi-grams, tri-grams, or syllables. It doesn't really matter what you choose, as long as they can combine freely.
You need to come up with an inventory of elements which comply with the rules of your language; you can collect those from text samples in the language you are aiming for.
In the simplest case, get a list of names like the ones you want to generate, and collect three-letter sequences from that, preferably with their frequency count. Or simply make some up:
For example, if you have a language with a syllablic structure where you always have a consonant followed by a vowel, then by combining elements which are a consonant followed by a vowel you will always end up with valid names.
Then pick 2 to 5 (or however long you want your names to be) elements randomly from that inventory, perhaps guided by their frequency.
You could also add in a filter to remove those with unsuitable letter combinations (at the element boundaries) afterwards. Or go through the element list and remove invalid ones (eg any ending in 'q' -- either drop them, or add a 'u' to them).
Depending on what inventory you're using, you can simulate different languages/cultures for your names, as languages differ in their phonological structures.",0.0,0.41105902,0.16896952688694,0.41105902,314,186

Write your equation with the name of your files. E.g. current_1 * voltage_1 (you need file current_1.csv, voltage_1.csv)

parse your equation with any parser. I used py_expression_eval.

Extract the variables from the equation (variables = parser.parse(equation).variables())

iterate over the variables and at each step:

load the data in a dataframe
insert the column of the measurement in general dataframe
change the name of that column to the name of your file (e.g. current_1)

by doing this you will obtain a dataframe with columns: time, measurement_1, measurement_2 ecc.

Use df.eval('result= ' + expression, inplace=True) to evaluate your initial expression using the columns you have added to the general dataframe

69,"I am collecting time series data, which can be separated into ""tasks"" based on a particular target value. These tasks can be numbered based on the associated target. However, the lengths of data associated with each task will differ because it may take less time or more time for a ""task"" to be completed. Right now in MATLAB, this data is separated by the target number into a MATLAB cell, which is extremely convenient as the analysis on this time-series data will be the same for each set of data associated with each target, and thus I can complete data analysis simply by using a for loop to go through each cell in the cell array. My knowledge on the closest equivalent of this in Python would be to generate a ragged array. However, through my research on answering this question, I have found that automatic setting of a ragged array has been deprecated, and that if you want to generate a ragged array you must set dtype = object. I have a few questions surrounding this scenario:

Does setting dtype=object for the ragged array come with any inherent limitations on how one will access the data within the array?

Is there a more convenient way of saving these ragged arrays as numpy files besides reducing dimensionality from 3D to 2D and also saving a file of the associated index? This would be fairly inconvenient I think as I have thousands of files for which it would be convenient to save as a ragged array.

Related to 2, is saving the data as a .npz file any different in practice in terms of saving an associated index? More specifically, would I be able to unpack the ragged arrays automatically based on a technically separate .npy file for each one and being able to assume that each set of data associated with each target is stored in the same way for every file?

Most importantly, is using ragged arrays really the best equivalent set-up for my task, or do I get the deprecation warning about setting dtype=object because manipulating data in this way has become redundant and Python3 has a better method for dealing with stacked arrays of varying size?","I have decided to move forward with a known solution to my problem, and it seems to be adapting well.
I organize each set of separate data into it's own array, and then store them in a sequence in a list as I would with cells in MATLAB.
To save this information, when I separated out the data I stored the subsequent index value in a list. By this I mean that:

I identify the location of the next separate set of data.
I copy the data up until that index value into an array that is appended to a list.
I store the index value that was the start of the next separate set of data.
I delete that information from a copy of my original array.
I repeat steps 1-4 until there is only one uniquely labelled sequence of data left. I append this set of data. There is no other index to record. Therefore the list of indices is equal to the length of the list of arrays -1.
When saving data, I take the original array and save it in a .npz file with the unpacking indices.
When I want to use and reload the data into it's separate arrays for analysis, I can 'pack' and 'unpack' the array into it's two different forms, from single numpy array to list of numpy arrays.

Within foo.py is a call to subprocess.run(...), this subprocess command runs in say `SUBPROCESS_SUBPROCESS
Within foo.py is subprocess.run(..., shell=True), this subprocess command runs in say SUBPROCESS_SUBPROCESS=True

Test for if a process/subprocess is equal
Say SUBPROCESS_A starts SUBPROCESS_B. In the below questions, when I say is SUBPROCESS_A == SUBPROCESS_B, what I means is if SUBPROCESS_B sets an env variable, when it runs to completion, will they env variable be set in SUBPROCESS_A? If one runs eval ""$(ssh-agent -s)"" in SUBPROCESS_B, will SUBPROCESS_A now have an ssh agent too?
Question
Using the above nomenclature and equality tests

Is BASH_PROCESS == PYTHON_SUBPROCESS?
Is PYTHON_SUBPROCESS == SUBPROCESS_SUBPROCESS?
Is PYTHON_SUBPROCESS == SUBPROCESS_SUBPROCESS=True?
If SUBPROCESS_SUBPROCESS=True is not equal to BASH_PROCESS, then how does one alter the executing environment (e.g. eval ""$(ssh-agent -s)"") so that a python script can set up the env for the calller?","None of those equalities are true, and half of those ""shells"" aren't actually shells.
Your bash shell is a shell. When you launch your Python script from that shell, the Python process that runs the script is a child process of the bash shell process. When you launch a subprocess from the Python script, that subprocess is a child process of the Python process. If you launch the subprocess with shell=True, Python invokes a shell to parse and run the command, but otherwise, no shell is involved in running the subprocess.
Child processes inherit environment variables from their parent on startup (unless you take specific steps to avoid that), but they cannot set environment variables for their parent. You cannot run a Python script to set environment variables in your shell, or run a subprocess from Python to set your Python script's environment variables.",0.4082,0.50440216,0.0092619219794869,0.09620216000000004,176,427

However, the idea is to make it so that the client chooses features that they want their store to have (from a pre-designated list) and pay only for those features, that way avoiding paying for something they don't need.
So for example, one client wants to have and online store with a Cart, Purchase History, Graphs, Reports. Another one only wants simple registration and cart (but maybe in future they will want me to ""enable"" other features as well).
My question is: what, in your opinion, is the best way to tackle this problem from a Django developer perspective?
My thoughts:

Create every feature as a separate app and deploy the whole thing commenting out the features that client did not pay for. And when a client wants additional features, I simply go to settings.py and uncomment the app they requested. Can I even make changes on the settings.py file on a live website without restarting it?
Create an admin panel for myself (the superuser) that will have an ability to turn features on or off. So when the client pays for a new feature, I simply go to my admin panel and put a tick mark next to it, and voila! That way I don't have to make changes in settings.py file (and I don't need access to the hosting server, just the django admin panel). Thought I'm not sure how to do this programmatically. I think I need a separate Model with a lot of BooleanFields(?)

What are pros and cons of each approach and what other ways to achieve this can you think of?
Edit 1.
To clarify, this will not be a shopify-style service, but simply a website that I will create separately for each client. But I want to have a blueprint to quickly create one and add/remove features on the fly.","I would recommend the admin panel approach.  If you plan to launch a service online that many people can access to generate a store front, you don't want to push code changes for a simple thing like adding a feature.  That would get cumbersome and is not a good practice.  Also modifying the settings.py file would typically need to have the web service (i.e. Apache) restarted so the file is reinitialized.
With the admin panel approach, then all you have to do is look up a customer, see what features they have and check boxes.  You could make it more complex of course, especially if a new added feature is going to cost the customer more.  But simply, the admin approach is best, it gives you the flexibility and you don't have to be worried about potentially taking down the site with a code push.",0.4082,0.28141642,0.0160647667944431,0.12678358,175,406

Will there be a class named hospital and under it will be staff,...

hospital would not have to be an object unless your system encompasses multiple hospitals (and each of them specialises in an area, etc...). By what I understand you don't need something like that, so you can ignore it.

staff, patients, pharmacy, and etc patients are considered what?

They would be each considered an object.

should they be an individual class?

Yes.
An example of where you can use polymorphism and inheritance would be between staff and patients. They are both people with common attributes such as name, gender, etc... So you could, create a superclass called person and have both staff and patient inherit it. Then create member variables and methods that are common to all people in the person class, while things such as health condition which are specific to patients can be kept in the patient class.

I understand the difference between an iterable and an iterator. However, couldn't we just simply implement the __next__ method on a list and somehow make it to go back to list[0] when StopIteration was raised? Wouldn't that free up some memory as iterators also allocate space in memory? What's really the reason for iterators to exist?
I also understand the difference between a generator and a list, for example. Also, there is a type of iterator for each object (e.g range_iterator). How are generator_iterators different from other iterator objects? Are they added values on the fly?","Iterators (objects representing streams of data) are created because
iterables (which iterators can be created from) couldn't keep the index
of the last element returned, because otherwise, you would only be
able to use it one at a time. So for that reason, each time you iterate over the same object, a new iterator is created. From the Python Wiki:


Iterators will typically need to maintain some kind of position state information (e.g., the index of the last element returned). If the iterable maintained that state itself, it would become inherently non-reentrant (meaning you could use it only one loop at a time).


Generator iterators (which in turn are returned by generator
functions) are also streams of data but generated on the fly. From
the Python Documentation:


generator iterator

The interaction between Teams and your bot is also not request/response it's actually request/request and the SDK does a reasonable job of abstracting this so you don't have to worry about it.
Having said that, as long as you have an api endpoint that will accept the messages being sent from Teams (and proxied through the bot service) you don't have to use the sdk, plus it's all open source so you can inspect the framework to see what it's doing...

Here is the simplified background:

4 shifts are available for assignation - RDO (Regular Day Off), M (Morning), D (Day) and N (Night). All of them are 8-hrs shift
Every employee will get 1 RDO per week and constant RDO is preferred (say staff A better to have Monday as day off constantly but this can be violate)
Same working shift (M / D / N) is preferred for every staff week by week (the constraint that I stuck on)
a. Example 1 (RDO at Monday): The shift of Tuesday to Sunday should be / have better to be the same
b. Example 2 (RDO at Thursday): The shift of Mon to Wed should be same as the last working day of prior week, while the shift of Fri to Sun this week also need to be same but not limit to be which shift

Since the RDO day (Mon - Sun) is different among employees, the constraint of point 3 also require to be changed people by people conditionally (say if RDO == ""Mon"" then do A ; else if RDO == ""Tue"" then do B), I have no idea how can it be reflected on the constraint as IF / ELSE statement cant really work on solver.

70,"I hope this isn’t off topic, I am not really sure which forum to use for a question like this:
I have a series of datapoints of about an hour in time from a sensor that retrieves data 20 times per second. Along with it I receive timestamps of a periodic event in this data in the format of %Y-%m-d %H:%M:%S.%f, which looks e.g. like this 2019-05-23 17:50:34.346000.
I now created a method to calculate these periodic events myself and was wondering how I could evalute my methods accuracy. My calculations are sometimes bigger and sometimes smaller by a few milliseconds compared to the actual timestamp. But when I run my own calculated timestamp against the actual timestamp by using pythons scipy.stats.pearsonr(x,y) method, I always receive a correlation of nearly 1. I assume that‘s because these small differences in the order of millisenconds don‘t seem relevant in an hour of data. But how could I evaluate the accuracy of two timestamps a reasonable way? Are there better metrics to use than the correlation?","It seems that you are trying to compute a linear statistical correlation (pearson) for something that is, by nature, a timeseries data. This will not tell you much and drawing a conclusion based on the results is dangerous.
It so happens that your two vectors x and y are growing linearly in the same direction which is not surprising given that they are timestamps.
Let's take an example for stationary data and time series data:
Time series data:
Your sensor starts giving measurements at time t1 and continues to do so until time t2 is reached. You compute the periodic event's timestamp using your own method then compare it to the actual timestamp. However, there is no reliable way using linear statistical correlations to see if the two are related and how related are they.
Stationary data :
Now consider the same sensor giving measurements, but now instead of computing your periodic events all at once, take a single event and compute it multiple times using your empirical data using different measurements (so forget about any notion of time at this point (i.e. repeat the measurement multiple times). The result can be averaged and an error on the mean can be computed (see info on standard error). This, now, can be compared to your single event. Based on the error, you can get a more or less feel of how good or bad your method is.
I would recommend the following :

You have your ground truth answer (say, the periodic event) y_truth. You compute a vector of the periodic events based on your sensor and your own method mapped as a function  f(sensor_input) = y_measured

Now you have two vectors, one measured and one that is ground truth. In each of those vectors, you have an indicator of a the periodic events such as an  id. I would repeat the whole set of measurements, on all  id's tens of times.

For each 'id' I would compute whatever measurement you are looking for (either a timestamp or time in seconds or whatever...) then I would subtract the two timestamps :  |y_truth - y_measured|. This is called residuals or in other words, your error.

Now averging all the residuals of all the id's gives you something called mean absolute error (1/n * sum (|y_truth - y_measured|) which you can very confidently use to report how much error, in a unit of time (seconds for example), your method produces.",0.4082,0.30368352,0.0109160197898745,0.10451648000000002,522,253

To answer your questions:

If there are no obvious choices about which image is best, then a random choice is fine. If you have e.g. a CT and an MRI for each subject, then co-registration using the CT images is likely going to give you better results because of intrinsic image characteristics (e.g. less distortion, image value linked to physical quantity).
I suppose that depends on what you want to do, but if it is important to have all imaging data in the same co-registered reference space then yes.

Thanks in advance","I just had the similar problem, and tl:dr the issue for me was multiple environments, like Ameya said. Here's a longer version of Ameya's spot-on answer with steps to diagnose and fix.
Without realizing it, I had two environments going on: my jupyter notebook was running python 3.10 and my global python was running 3.9, and each was looking for site-packages in different locations (/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jupyterlab/3.4.7/libexec/lib/python3.10/site-packages vs /Users//Library/Python/3.9/lib/site-packages).
This happened because I had trouble with getting python and specifically jupyterlab running on Monterey and the only fix for me was using homebrew to manage the packages. Anything I installed with brew from the command line, went into /opt/homebrew/Cellar... etc and could be seen by my jupyter notebook. Anything I used pip install to get from within an open notebook also went onto this path that my notebook could see. But anything I used pip install from the command line to get, went to the path of the global environment's site packages. Then, my jupyter notebook couldn't see them.
You don't mention that you are using jupyter notebook but perhaps something analogous could happen between multiple environments for you.
You can check if this is the case for you by doing the following:

start python from the command line
import sys
run sys.path
start jupyter notebook, or start python from your other environment
same thing, import sys, run sys.path

Are they the same? If not, probably pip is putting your rasterio in other python env site-packages.
To fix, you can either pip install from within your preferred environment, or copy and paste the site packages corresponding to rasterio from one site-packages location to the other.",0.0,0.47605538,0.2266287356615066,0.47605538,419,113

6,"As far as I understand, Gitpod creates a pod which runs a Linux server container that includes my pre-configured IDE.
I am not too familiar with pods and containers, so please correct me if I'm wrong.
To my understanding, a container is essentially a VM, or are there any differences between the two?
Now, moving on to Python, which I am also just getting to know.
So a common practice is to set up a virtual environment, so that packages will be installed in there, and not globally, on the computer running the project.

Note - I will be abbreviating with ""venv"", but I will not be specifically referring to venv/virtualenv/etc.

Comparing it to NodeJS with which I am more familiar, that would be the same as using project/.node_modules vs usr/local/lib/.node_modules
By default npm i installs on the repository, and only installs on the machine when using the -g option.
Is that correct so far?*

So, with that information in mind, since Gitpod is running a container specifically built to serve as a single project IDE - Do I even need to run a venv?

I can see a use case in which I may be testing how my code runs against Python3 and Python2.8, thus using two different venvs
(I now wonder how that would look code-wise, how would the scripts import the correct libraries, but that question is way off-topic 😅)

Anyway, my question assumes:

If I were to use it on a local machine, I'd only need one venv
In terms of Python version and package collisions:

Either the default Gitpod image satisfies my needs
Or, well, I can edit the image myself anyway




* Footnote - I apologise for asking many questions beside the main one.
I hope it is not against the rules, I simply want to know if I understand correctly","In an attempt to answer this objectively, I think the shortest argument for using both boils down to:

The Gitpod provides your development environment: editors, IDEs, Python installations that a virtual environment can use, etc.

The virtual environment provides your application's execution environment: the exact Python version and packages it needs to run.

better solution: you get a 33 random 32-bit values, put them in a buffer, take the lowest 66 bit (using bitwise operations, &), and then shift your index into the buffer. For the next random value, you take the next 66 bit from your buffer through bitwise operations.

Also make sure you actually need all your randomness to come from the operating system. This is usually not the case. In most practical applications, you seed your pseudo-random number generator once with random values from your OS, and then have a very cheap way of generating sufficiently random/secure random numbers. It depends on what you build!
But especially for things like session tokens, you don't need incredibly cryptographically secure values - take a (properly) seeded PRNG, get sufficiently many bits, append a secret salt to the end, run a SHA-256 hash on it, get a session token that cannot be guessed, and knowledge of one would not allow you to infer any other valid tokens.",0.102,0.28972423,0.0352250598371028,0.18772423000000005,239,55

Basically what the title indicates. We have that app and we have to migrate it to microservices.
We didn't find any solid approach (or we felt it like that) about this. What we ended up doing is creating 1 project per microservice (a single functionality related to a module app, in general) but then we had some problems because we already had a database to work with since this is already a functioning app.
We had problems communicating with the existing models, so basically what we did was to point in every settings.py of the projects to the existing DB, and with python3 manage.py inspectdb, we grabbed the existing models. This approach ended up working, but we feel that is not the best approach. We had a lot of problems with circular imports and more.
Is out there good practices about microservices with Django, and how to properly do it, like in most of the cases that we want to create something with the framework?
If someone knows or has something we would really appreciate it!","you can use Django for Microservices. in this case you have only one few apps, and you start every service on own port:
first Django project
pdf generator + views generate small pdf
second Django project.
pdf generator + views generate big pdf (code can inherit other project)
orchestra:
third Django project: Autorization + call big or small pdf generator service
settings
settings.py for first and second is very easy and allows only call from internal ip's. here we don't need middleaware, template, cache, admin and other settings.
settings.py for orchestra is also very easy and used only auth and made call by internal ip ant send response to user. Here we don't need much middlaware, and don't need many other settings.
gains:

All is independent. if one server fall, other can work.
Updates are easy. One small server update is always easy than monolith update.
development is easy: three small teams works on own small projects.
Units testing is easy and fast
For complex business goals the whole system is faster.

pains:

after 100 micro-services it is completely complex to work with that all.
code style from many teams is always different. Don't matter how strict you define styleguide or settings for black-linter.

Having a separate app for your catalogue of items and your projects is a good idea, but having them together in one is not a problem if you have a small codebase.
If I have understood your post correctly, what you want is for the databases of different departments to be separate. This is essentially a multi-tenancy question which is a big topic in itself, there are a few options:

Code separation - all of your projects/departments exist in a single database and schema but are separate by code that filters departments depending on who the end user is (literally by using Django .filters()). This is easy to do but there is a risk that data could be leaked to the wrong user if you get your code wrong. I would recommend this one for your use-case.

Schema separation - you are still using a single database but each department has its own schema. You would need to use Postgresql for this but once a schema has been set, there is far less chance that data is going to be visible to the wrong user. There are some Django libraries such as django-tenants that can do a lot of the heavy lifting.

Database separation - each department has their own database. There is even less of a chance that data will be leaked but you have to manage multi-databases and it is more difficult to scale. You can manage this through django as there is support for multi-databases.

Application separation - each department not only has their own database but their own application instance. The separation is absolute but again you need to manage multiple applications on a host like Heroku, which is even less scalable.",0.0,0.55884653,0.3123094439506531,0.55884653,378,295

My code runs beautifully (albeit slowly) on my own laptop with TensorFlow 2.7.3. The HPC server I am using has a newer version of python (3.9.0) and TensorFlow installed.
Onto my problem: The Keras callback function ""Earlystopping"" no longer works as it should on the server. If I set the patience to 5, it will only run for 5 epochs despite specifying epochs = 50 in model.fit(). It seems as if the function is assuming that the val_loss of the first epoch is the lowest value and then runs from there.
I don't know how to fix this. The function would reach lowest val_loss at 15 epochs and run to 20 epochs on my own laptop. On the server, training time and epochs is not sufficient, with very low accuracy (~40%) on test dataset.

Warehouse A = 90 throughput rate per hour - Max Capacity 1,200,000

Warehouse E = 95 throughput rate per hour - Max Capacity 1,100,000

I have 5,000,000 units of volume that I need to distribute to these 5 warehouses. The idea is to reduce cost so the most efficient warehouse should get as much of this volume until it hits its maximum capacity after which it moves to the warehouse with the second best throughput rate.
So in this example Warehouse C will get allocated as much volume as it can take before they hit their max capacity. Then it will move to warehouse E, then Warehouse A. The algorithm should stop as soon as the 5,000,000 units are used up.

5,"For the past few days, i've been trying to set up a FastAPI & Uvicorn server on my Windows machine (although the main idea is to set it up on an old Android device that i dont use anymore.)
The server (in both my android and my pc) can be reached by any machine in my local network. The problem comes when I try to access it through my public IP. So far I have done everything i can think of to try solv it:

Port forwarding TCP port 8000 (and others) to my PC's and Android's IP.
Allow incoming and outgoing connections in Windows's Firewall (not sure how to do this in Android though)

Some things to have in mind:

I don't want to host the server in the cloud as it needs to interact with local devices. For example, to send WOL packages to my laptop.
I have tried to use reverse proxy services like Ngrok, but the link changes every X amount of time, so it's not reliable enough.
My android device,which is a Sony E2053, currently runs rooted 4.4.4 kitkat, without the possibility to install a custom ROM (locked bootloader).

I barely have knowledge about networking so I'm really messed up with this. Any help is aprecciated.","This question is way to broad for StackOverflow, and is highly dependent on the specifics of your situation. However, to get you going here is a highlevel overview of how it would normally work.
Situation: you have a house, in which there is a internet connection to which your computer is connected. There are two networks at play: your internal network (LAN) and your internet (WAN). Your modem/router connects these two networks together. Your computer has a internal IP (10.x.x.x or 192.x.x.x typically), so has your modem/router. Your modem/router also has a public IP address. You can find that public IP when going to websites as whatismyip.com.
In order for your local computer to be reachable via the internet, you need to forward the traffic meant for you computer to your computer on your modemrouter. Typically this is done by portforwarding on the modemrouter. On your modemrouter there would be a setting that let you forward all incoming traffic on port 8000 to :8000.
Then, when you ar eon the internet and browse to :8000, the request is forwarded to your computer and returned to you over the internet.
However, since you are very novice at this stuff, I would HIGHLY advise against such setup. The internet is a scary place and opening yourself up to attack is never a good idea.",0.0,0.32369637,0.104779340326786,0.32369637,300,277

There is a known solution anyway, by reducing the equation (via a lengthy substitution process) to the form x^5 - x + t = 0 known as the Bring–Jerrard normal form, and getting the solutions (called ultraradicals) by means of the elliptic functions of Hermite or evaluation of the roots by Taylor.

Personal note:
This approach is virtually foolish, as there exist ready-made numerical polynomial root-finders, and the ultraradical function is uneasy to evaluate.
Anyway, looking at the plot of x^5 - x, one can see that it is intersected once or three times by and horizontal, and finding an interval with a change of sign is easy. With that, you can obtain an accurate root by dichotomy (and far from the extrema, Newton will easily converge).

15,"I am want to connect/know if there are ways to get Bloomberg data to Python. I see we can connect through blpapi/pdblp package.
So wanted to check what is the pricing for this. Appreciate if anyone can help me here?
Getting ways to connect to Python to get Bloomberg data","Bloomberg has a number of products, which support the real-time API known as the BLP API. This API is a microservice based API. They have microservices for streaming marketdata (//blp/mktdata), requesting static reference (//blp/refdata), contributing OTC pricing (//firm/c-gdco), submitting orders (//blp/emsx), etc etc. The API supports a number of languages including Python, Perl, C++, .NET, etc. The API pattern requires setting up a session where you 'target'/connect to a delivery point. There are several flavours of delivery points depending on what Bloomberg products you buy. For the Bloomberg (Professional) Terminal, you have something called Desktop API (DAPI), they have something called the Server (SAPI), they have something called B-PIPE, another is EMSX. They all present delivery points. They all support the same BLP API.
The Bloomberg Terminal's delivery point is localhost:8194. No Bloomberg Terminal, no localhost delivery point. However, maybe your organisation has bought an Enterprise B-PIPE product, in which case you don't need a Bloomberg Terminal, and the delivery point will sit on at least two servers (IPs), again on port 8194.
So, bottom line, the API library is available and you can develop against it. Problem is, the first few lines of creating a session object and connecting to the end point will fail unless you have a Bloomberg product. There's no sandbox, sadly.
Pricing depends on product, and unfortunately you'll also need to consider your application use-case. As an example, if you're writing a systematic trading application, then the licensing of the Bloomberg (Professional) Terminal will not permit that, however, a B-PIPE will include a licence that will permit that (plus hefty exchange fees if not OTC).

Which algorithm you choose then depends on your use case:

If the data is most likely already sorted or partially sorted: You may go with an algorithm that has better best case runtime
If you want fastest results in most cases (with unsorted data): You go for best normal case

Generally, plotting with matplotlib involves a figure and one or more axes. A figure can be thought of as a frame where multiple plots can be created inside. Each plot consists of an axes object which contains your x- and y-axis and so on.
With the command plt.subplots(), you create in a single function a figure object and one or more axes objects. If you pass no parameters to the function, just a single axes object will get created that is placed on the figure object. The figure and axes are returned as a tuple by the function in the form of (figure, axes). You are unpacking that tuple with the first line into the variable fig and ax.
Then, when you call the plotting function on your pandas data, you tell the function on which axes object to do the plotting. This is what the parameter ax means in that function. So you are telling the function to use your axes object that your variable ax is assigned to by setting the parameter ax to ax (ax = ax).
Doing ax = tips[['total_bill','tip']].plot... is redundant. The plotting function returns the axes object on which the plotting was performed by pandas. However, you are just overwriting your already existing axes with the returned axes, which in this case are the same object. This would only be needed if you don't pass the ax parameter to the plotting function, in which case pandas would create a brandnew figure and axes object for you and return the axes object in case you want to do any further tweaks to it.",0.0,0.5070753,0.2571253776550293,0.5070753,365,110

30,"I'm using the RSA encryption/decryption system, and I have the modulus n (which is a 2048 bit number) and I need to find p and q, which satisfy n = p*q and both are prime numbers. The clue that is given to me is that p is equal to q but with its bits inverted as I say in the title of this post (concretely r and s have the same bits so we could say that p and q have their halves inverted). I don't find the way to take advantage of this so I would be very grateful if someone could help me
I have tried to traverse the number n to find the number p that satisfies that p * p_halfs_inverted = n but logically n is too huge and it is not viable to do it in this way.","OK here's how you can solve this problem.
Start by representing p and q in terms of two k-bit numbers r and s as follows (for your example, k=512):

p = 2kr + s
q = 2ks + r

The value of n is the product of these two numbers:

n   =   pq   =   (2kr + s)(2ks + r)   =   22krs + 2k(r2 + s2) + rs

The first two terms on the right are both multiples of 2k, so the k lowest bits of n are exactly equal to the k lowest bits of rs. Furthermore, since rs is typically a 2k-bit number and r2 + s2 is typically a (2k+1)-bit number, the k highest bits of n are also mostly equal to the k highest bits of rs, but perhaps slightly larger due to the carry generated when adding the 2k(r2 + s2) term.
If n◁ and n▷ are numbers representing the top k bits and bottom k bits of n, then we can generate a candidate value for rs by calculating 2kn◁ + n▷. If this value is correct, we can subtract (22k + 1)rs from n to obtain the value of 2k(r2 + s2). Divide this result by 2k and add 2rs to obtain r2 + 2rs + s2, then calculate the square root of this value to obtain the value of r + s. (If the number isn't a perfect square, then you need to subtract 1 from n◁ and try again.
After at most two iterations of this process, you will have the exact values of rs and r+s. You should then have no difficulty solving a simultaneous equation to obtain values for r and s, from which you can find p and q.
Note: You might find the sympy.sqrt() function useful for calculating square roots of large numbers. It returns objects with an is_integer attribute that will tell you if the number you provided was a perfect square.",0.4082,0.48700154,0.0062154713086783,0.07880154,449,168

If each file contains observations for a different entity AND you want to predict observations about EACH specific known entity, you can build a model for each entity. In this case, the entities with more training data will of course have better results.
Still, if the difference between those entities can be described with numerical values, depending on the exact problem, you can also try adding those to the training data and then concatenating everything. In this case, the added features will make the final classification to better classify the observations of each different entity without building 100 models. Note however that this could work only if the ""qualities"" of the entities actually affect the observations in some degree, otherwise (if the observations are randomly distributed amongst the entities) the results will probably be worse.
If however the observations of different entities are needed to train a model that works for any entity (including unknown ones), the data can be concatenated to a single table (pandas DataFrames were mentioned in the question) and then train your model with this combined dataset.",0.0,0.25992888,0.0675630271434784,0.25992888,238,163

once the button is released, compute the size of the rectangle (in pixels).

57,"I'm using the BeautifulSoup module in Python 3.10 to get HTML data off a web page.
The way this web page is structured, there's a bunch of <h1> tags which section the web page. Some of these will look like <h1 class=""title""><img attributes/> Text</h1>, and some will lack the img element but are otherwise identical.

The logic should be able to map Yr to Sales Year and map Year to Acc Year automatically.

Thanks in advance!","Generally this is impossible as there is no solid/consistent factor by which we can map the columns.
That being said what one can do is use cosine similarity to calculate how similar one string (in this case the column name) is to other strings in another dataframe.
So in your case, we'll get 4 vectors for the first dataframe and 4 for the other one. Now calculate the cosine similarity between the first vector(PO ID) from the first dataframe and first vector from second dataframe (PO ID). This will return 100% as both the strings are same.
For each and every column, you'll get 4 confidence scores. Just pick the highest and map them.
That way you can get a makeshift logic through which you can map the column although there are loopholes in this logic too. But it is better than nothing as that way the number of columns to be mapped by the user will be less as compared to mapping them all manually.

I'm debating on how often to use heapify().","The obvious answer is yes. If you supply a sorted array to heapify it won't have to perform any swaps at all. If you supply a reverse-sorted array it will have to perform the maximum number of swaps.
That said, there is no benefit to pre-sorting the array before passing it to heapify because the total time (i.e. analyzing and arranging the array, plus heapify time) will exceed the maximum time required for heapify to do its work on even the worst-case arrangement.
That said, you shouldn't have to call heapify more than once. That is, you call heapify to construct the heap. Then you call the heappush and heappop methods to add and remove items.
I suppose, if you have to add a large number of items to an existing heap, you could append them to an existing heap and then call heapify to re-build the heap.

Are there a couple lines I can add to my Lambda function to ignore the error?
Alternatively, maybe ""inf"" should just be replaced by the largest possible float value, or something like that?

91,"there may very well be an answer to this question, but it's really hard to google for.
you can add commands to gdb by writing them in python. I am interested in debugging one of those python scripts that's running in gdb session.
my best guess is to run gdb on gdb and execute the user added command and somehow magically break on the python program code?
has anybody done anything like this before? I don't know the mechanism by which gdb calls python code, so if it's not in the same process space as the gdb that's calling it, I don't see how I'd be able to set breakpoints in the python program.

anybody have any idea?
thanks.","so I figured it out. it's kinda neat.
you run gdb to debug your program as normal, then in another window you attach to a running python program.
in this case the running python program is the gdb process.
once you attach, you can set breakpoints in the python program, and then when you run commands in the first window where the gdb session is, if it hits a breakpoint in the python code, it will pop up in the second window.
the tipoff was that when you run gdb there does not appear to be any other python process that's a child of gdb or related anywhere, so I figured gdb must dynamically link to some python library so that the python compiler/interpreter must be running in the gdb process space, so I figured I'd try attaching to that, and it worked.",0.0,0.22281545,0.0496467277407646,0.22281545,178,239

But searching how to do so only led me to innate/library functions in other programming languages.
Is there a way in PyMuPDF to get the optimal/maximal font size given a rectangle, the text and the font?","As @Seon wrote, there is rc = page.insert_textbox(), which does nothing if the text does not fit. This is indicated by a negative float rc - the rectangle height deficite.
If positive however, the text has been written and it is too late for optimizing the font size.
You can of course create a Font object for your font and check text length beforehand using tl = font.text_length(text, fontsize=fs). Dividing tl / rect.width gives you an approximate number of lines in the rectangle, which you can compare with the rectangle height: rect.height / (fs * factor) in turn is a good estimate for the number of available lines in the rect.
The fontsize fs alone does not take the actual line height into account: the ""natural"" line height of a font is computed using its ascender and decender values lh = (font.ascender - font.descender) * fs. So the above computation should better be rect.height / lh for the number of fitting lines.
.insert_textbox() has a lineheight parameter: a factor overriding the default (font.ascender - font.descender).
Decent visual appearances can usually be achieved by setting lineheight=1.2.
To get a good fit for your text to fit in a rectangle in one line, choose fs = rect.width / font.text_length(text, fontsize=1) for the fontsize.
All this however is no guarantee for how a specific PDF viewer will react WRT text form fields. They have their own idea about necessary text borders, so you will need some experimenting.",0.4082,0.6324398,0.0502999536693096,0.2242398,351,99

I will start digging around Sorl internals to find a more useful place to delay this task, but there are a few more things I'm curious about if this has been solved before.

What image is returned immediately? Sorl must be told somehow that the image returned is not the real thumbnail. The cache must be invalidated when celery finishes the task.
Handle multiple thumbnail generation requests cleanly (only need the first one for a given cache key)

I'm really new to Python programming, and what I need to do is this:
I have a .csv file in which each line represent a person and each column represents a variable.
This .csv file comes from an agent-based C++ simulation I have done.
Now, I need to read each line of this file and for each line generate a new instance of the class Person(), passing as arguments every variable line by line.
My problem is this: what is the most pythonic way of generating these agents while keeping their unique ID (which is one of the attributes I want to read from the file)? Do you suggest creating a class dictionary for accessing every instance? But I still need to provide a name to every single instance, right? How can I do that dynamically? Probably the best thing would be to use the unique ID, read from the file, as the instance name, but I think that numbers can't be used as instance names, can they? I miss pointers! :(
I am sure there is a pythonic solution I cannot see, as I still have to rewire my mind a bit to think in pythonic ways...

I keep all my data in a Django ORM and have a bunch of Celery tasks that run at different intervals that makes sure that new invoices and invoice reminders get sent and cuts of access when users don't pay their invoices. 
For example I'd like to be a able to run a test that:

Creates a new user and generates an invoice for X days of access to the site
Simulates the passing of X + 1 days, and runs all the tasks I've got set up in Celery.
Checks that a new invoice for an other X days has been issued to the user.

The KISS approach I've come up with so far is to do all the testing on a separate machine and actually manipulate the date/time at the OS-level. So the testing script would:

Set the system date to day 1
Create a new user and generate the first invoice for X days of access
Advance then system date 1 day. Run all my celery tasks. Repeat until X + 1 days have ""passed""
Check that a new invoice has been issued

39,"I'm following a python website for my schoolwork. It's really neat, it gives you tasks to complete and compiles the code in the browser. Anyway, I came to a challenge that I'm not really sure how to go about.
One of the questions was:

The same substring may occur several times inside the same string: for example ""assesses"" has the substring ""sses"" 2 times, and
  ""trans-Panamanian banana"" has the substring ""an"" 6 times. Write a
  program that takes two lines of input, we call the first needle and
  the second haystack. Print the number of times that needle occurs as a
  substring of haystack.

I'm not too sure how I should start this, I know I have to compare the two strings but how? I used the count method, but it didn't recognize the second occurrence of sses in assesses.
My second question is one I solved but I cheated a little.
The question was:

Write a program that takes a single input line of the form «number1»+«number2», where both of these represent positive integers,
  and outputs the sum of the two numbers. For example on input 5+12 the
  output should be 17.

I used the eval() method and it worked, I just think that this wasn't what the grader had in mind for this.
Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
EDIT: Second question was solved.","

53,"Background
I have a Django application, it works and responds pretty well on low load, but on high load like 100 users/sec, it consumes 100% CPU and then due to lack of CPU slows down.
Problem:

Profiling the application gives me time taken by functions.
This time increases on high load.
Time consumed may be due to complex calculation or for waiting for CPU.

So, how to find the CPU cycles consumed by a piece of code ?
Since reducing the CPU consumption will increase the response time.

I might have written extremely efficient code and need to add more CPU power 

OR

I might have some stupid code taking the CPU and causing the slow down ?

Update

I am using Jmeter to profile my web app, it gives me a throughput of 2 requests/sec. [ 100 users]
I get a average time of 36 seconds on 100 request vs 1.25 sec time on 1 request.

More Info

Configuration Nginx + Uwsgi with 4 workers
No database used, using a responses from a REST API
On 1st hit the response of REST API gets cached, therefore doesn't makes a difference.

I realize that Python only uses indentation to define blocks of code, and that the final program may not contain brackets.
However, I find it very annoying that your program can stop functioning just because of an unfortunate and undetected carriage-return.
So, ideally I would be looking for a plugin in a text editor (kate, gedit...) that would:

65,"Okay., We have Rails webapp which stores data in a mysql data base. The table design was not read efficient. So we resorted to creating a separate set of read only tables in mysql and made all our internal API calls use that tables for read. We used callbacks to keep the data in sync between both the set of tables. Now we have a another Python app which is going to mess with the same database - now how do we proceed maintaining the data integrity? 
Active record callbacks can't be used anymore. We know we can do it with triggers. But is there a any other elegant way to do this? How to people achieve to maintain the integrity of such derived data."," -------------

66,"I'm interested in tries and DAWGs (direct acyclic word graph) and I've been reading a lot about them but I don't understand what should the output trie or DAWG file look like.

Should a trie be an object of nested dictionaries? Where each letter is divided in to letters and so on?
Would a lookup performed on such a dictionary be fast if there are 100k or 500k entries?
How to implement word-blocks consisting of more than one word separated with - or space?
How to link prefix or suffix of a word to another part in the structure? (for DAWG)

I want to understand the best output structure in order to figure out how to create and use one.
I would also appreciate what should be the output of a DAWG along with trie.

68,"We are writing an inventory system and I have some questions about sqlalchemy (postgresql) and transactions/sessions. This is a web app using TG2, not sure this matters but to much info is never a bad. 

How can make sure that when changing inventory qty's that i don't run into race conditions. If i understand it correctly if user on is going to decrement inventory on an item to say 0 and user two is also trying to decrement the inventory to 0 then if user 1s session hasn't been committed yet then user two starting inventory number is going to be the same as user one resulting in a race condition when both commit, one overwriting the other instead of having a compound effect.
If i wanted to use postgresql sequence for things like order/invoice numbers how can I get/set next values from sqlalchemy without running into race conditions?

EDIT: I think i found the solution i need to use with_lockmode, using for update or for share. I am going to leave open for more answers or for others to correct me if I am mistaken.
TIA","

Then when any of the processes wanted to retrieve an object with a given key they would just ask the db for the memory location for the given key, the server would respond with the location and the module would know how to load that space in memory and transfer the python object back to the python process.
Is that wholly unreasonable or just really damn hard to implement?  Am I chasing after something that's impossible? Any suggestions would be welcome.  Thank you internet.","  thanks!
Thanks!

I think the answer to your questions would really depend on what you're trying with.

96,"I can't believe I have to ask this, but I have spent almost three hours looking for the answer.  Anyway, I have Eric IDE 4 installed on my linux distro.  I can't seem to download any plugins to the plugins repository.  
The only one I really want is the Django plugin so when I start a new project in Eric, the Django option shows.  The plugin repository just shows me an empty folder for .eric4/eric4plugins and there's no follow up as to where I can get the plugins from somewhere else.  Actually, there was a hinting at it on the Eric docs site, but what I ended up getting was the ENTIRE trunk for eric.  And the plugins that came with the trunk are just the bare bones ones that ship with it.  I didn't get the Django one and the documentation on the Eric site is seriously lacking and overly complex.
Anyone know how I can just get the Django snap in?"," Anyhow, in the meantime, what is my install-and-install instructions about?  So, now I want to know more, how to create a django-dev for any one of those plugins, even if I'm not doing the plugin at the moment.

97,"I'm trying to write out a piece of code that can reduce the LENGTH of a boolean expression to the minimum, so the code should reduce the number of elements in the expression to as little as possible. Right now I'm stuck and I need some help =[
Here's the rule: there can be arbitrary number of elements in a boolean expression, but it only contains AND and OR operators, plus brackets. 
For example, if I pass in a boolean expression: ABC+BCD+DE, the optimum output would be BC(A+D)+DE, which saves 2 unit spaces compared to the original one because the two BCs are combined into one. 
My logic is that I will attempt to find the most frequently appeared element in the expression, and factor it out. Then I call the function recursively to do the same thing to the factored expression until it's completely factored. 
However, how can I find the most common element in the original expression? That is, in the above example, BC? It seems like I would have to try out all different combinations of elements, and find number of times each combination appears in the whole expression. But this sounds really naive. 
Second 
Can someone give a hint on how to do this efficiently? Even some keywords I can search up on Google will do.","

About each iteration, each object's value is assigned the maximum number (including the iteration numbers) to which it is to be appended to the end. If you take care to leave as much of the objects as possible in memory, you can save more memory than you need.

We have looked at the Steam API, and to find this information, it requires the person's 64 bit ID (steamID64) and we, on the website, are only given the username. In order to find their 64 bit id, we have tried to scrape off of a website (steamidconverter.com) to get the user's 64 bit id from their username.

27,"I'm at the start of creating a chess engine. When I created a function that checks if a move is legal, first I had to make the move and then check if the move had put my king in check and then unmake it. 
After giving some thought on how to make a function that unmakes a move, I decided it's much simpler to just copy the board and make the hypothetical move on the copied board, so it doesn't change the original board structure at all.
But I'm worried this might be a bad idea because when I get to the AI part, as I have to copy the board completely, and it might slow down my engine. Is it so? Could you please share your thoughts about this, since I don't know much about algorithm complexity and that kind of stuff.

29,"I have an application written in Python 2.7 that reads user's file from the hard-drive using os.walk.
The application requires a UTF-8 system locale (we check the env variables before it starts) because we handle files with Unicode characters (audio files with the artist name in it for example), and want to make sure we can save these files with the correct file name to the filesystem.
Some of our users have UTF-8 locales (therefore a UTF-8 fs), but still somehow manage to have ISO-8859-1 files stored on their drive. This causes problems when our code tries to os.walk() these directories as Python throws an exception when trying to decode this sequence of ISO-8859-1 bytes using UTF-8.
So my question is, how do I get python to ignore this file and move on to the next one instead of aborting the entire os.walk(). Should I just roll my own os.walk() function?
Edit: Until now we've been telling our users to use the convmv linux command to correct their filenames, however many users have various different types of encodings (8859-1, 8859-2, etc.), and using convmv requires the user to make an educated guess on what files have what encoding before they run convmv on each one individually.","

49,"I'm trying to work out how to approach building a ""machine"" to send and receive messages to WebSphere MQ, via Twisted.  I want it to be as generic as possible, so I can reuse it for many different situations that interface with MQ.
I've used Twisted before, but many years ago now and I'm trying to resurrect the knowledge I once had...
The specific problem I'm having is how to implement the MQ IO using Twisted.  There's a pymqi Python library that interfaces with MQ, and it provides all the interfaces I need.  The MQ calls I need to implement are:

initiate a connection to a specific MQ server/port/channel/queue-manager/queue combination
take content and post it as a message to the desired queue
poll a queue and return the content of the next message in the queue
send a request to a queue manager to find the number of messages currently in a queue

All of these involve blocking calls to MQ.
As I'm intending to reuse the Twisted/MQ interface many times across a range of projects, should I be looking to implement the MQ IO as a Twisted protocol, as a Twisted transport, or just call the pymqi methods via deferToThread() calls?  I realise this is a very broad question with possibly no definitive answer; I'm really after advice from those who may have encountered similar challenges before (i.e. working with queueing interfaces that will always block) and found a way that works well.","

 First, note that the number of nodes in the graph in question is called the connectivity, and in general (i.e. in-degree) its number is not.

Test that the image file is correct. To do that I'd have to either generate an image to compare to (but how do I generate that 'trustworthy' image?), or write a unit-testable image-writing module (so I wouldn't need to bother with the external library at all).

The idea is to read the contents of the file and find out which ones are bad (containing data other than integers)

The question is, how do I do this?
By reading each line and pickling it, would not help since readline by default reads it as a string. Thereby upon pickling, it's really just pickling a string into a serialized python object representation and unpickling would only return it as a string. Thus the actual data in the line, such as integers or chars are being represented as strings irrespective. 
So I assume the question is, how do I pickle things the right way OR how do I process each line of a file ensuring that it's data types are being maintained?","   Theoretically, pickles will only pick the data being processed so much and then you just call pickled() with the string data.

libpcap / pcap.h allows to me read packets at the network card, however I haven't yet been able to figure out a way to stop these packets or inject new ones into the network.

81,"I am using the Python C API and trying to create a function that will allocate new instances of PyTypeObjects to use in several C++ classes. The idea is that each class would have a pointer to a PyTypeObject that would get instantiated with this factory. The pointers must be static. 
However, I'm having issues with this approach.

In the class that contains the pointer to the PyTypeObject, I get the ""undefined reference"" linker error when I try to set that static variable equal to the result of the factory function (which is in another class but is static). I suppose this makes sense because the function wouldn't happen until runtime but I don't know another way to do this.
I don't know how to set the PyTypeObject fields dynamically because the first field is always a macro: PyObject_VAR_HEAD. 

Hope this makes sense. Basically, I'm trying to make it so several classes don't have to redefine PyTypeObject statically, but can instead instantiate their PyTypeObject variables from a factory function.","

Django ORM. Can it handle it? Getting all objects, splitting it up, and updating from >50 threads?

Instead of using something like [renderObject] which returns a render method, you can also use the render_object method.  Something like:

92,"I have a collection that is potentially going to be very large. Now I know MongoDB doesn't really have a problem with this, but I don't really know how to go about designing a schema that  can handle a very large dataset comfortably. So I'm going to give an outline of the problem.
We are collecting large amounts of data for our customers. Basically, when we gather this data it is represented as a 3-tuple, lets say (a, b, c), where b and c are members of sets B and C respectively. In this particular case we know that the B and C sets will not grow very much over time. For our current customers we are talking about ~200,000 members. However, the A set is the one that keeps growing over time. Currently we are at about ~2,000,000 members per customer, but this is going to grow (possibly rapidly.) Also, there are 1->n relations between b->a and c->a.
The workload on this data set is basically split up into 3 use cases. The collections will be periodically updated, where A will get the most writes, and B and C will get some, but not many. The second use case is random access into B, then aggregating over some number of documents in C that pertain to b \in B. And the last usecase is basically streaming a large subset from A and B to generate some new data.
The problem that we are facing is that the indexes are getting quite big. Currently we have a test setup with about 8 small customers, the total dataset is about 15GB in size at the moment, and indexes are running at about 3GB to 4GB. The problem here is that we don't really have any hot zones in our dataset. It's basically going to get an evenly distributed load amongst all documents.
Basically we've come up with 2 options to do this. The one that I described above, where all data for all customers is piled into one collection. This means we'd have to create an index om some field that links the documents in that collection to a particular customer.
The other options is to throw all b's and c's together (these sets are relatively small) but divide up the C collection, one per customer. I can imangine this last solution being a bit harder to manage, but since we rarely access data for multiple customers at the same time, it would prevent memory problems. MongoDB would be able to load the customers index into memory and just run from there.
What are your thoughts on this?
P.S.: I hope this wasn't too vague, if anything is unclear I'll go into some more details.","[

And if im not mistaken., once I have sent this command (assuming that I code this in python)

conn.modules.os.popen(""scp  xxx@localhost:file1.txt yyy@]192.168.104.XXX:file2.txt"")

and followed by this command

conn.modules.os.popen(""yes"")

Setup:
I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 64bit, Python3.2, Pyramid 1.3.3, SQLAlchemy 0.7.8 and using the standard waitress server. 
Symptoms
I was having some efficiency issues so used system monitor to try to see what was up and found that while pyramid is doing its processing and suchlike for the view I described my ram usage rose steadily. As the html form was displayed in my browser the ram usage leveled off but didn't fall. Reloading the view caused the ram usage to grow steadily from where it left off.

State is an object held by Engine that has its update method called each time Engine's step function is called.

Catching the signal in Python is not the issue, lots of information about that.
But how to get back information to the process initiating the signal? It seems that there is no way to figure out the pid of the initiating process by the receiving process, which could provide a way to send information back. A single reply message is enough here (in the tune of 'busy uploading; at 55% now; will finish at such a time'); a continuing update would be fantastic but not necessary.
What I've come up with is to write this data to a temporary file with predetermined name - has the issue of leaving stale files behind, and need some kind of clean-up routine then. But that sounds like a hack. Is there anything better available?
The way the running process is signalled doesn't matter, it doesn't have to be kill -SIGUSR1 pid. Any way to communicate with it would do. As long as the communication can be initiated from a new process that's started after the main process runs, possibly running under as different user.","

58,"I am attempting to teach myself python and have hit a rough spot once it has come to recursion. I have done the classic recursive functions (factorial, fibonacci numbers...) but I am going back over old code and trying to convert most of my iterative functions to recursive functions for practice.
This is the wall that I have hit:
I made a dungeon crawler a while back and I am trying to replace a for loop I used to reveal the squares near my sprite. So when the sprite is placed, he/she sees the tile he/she is on as well as the adjacent and diagonal squares (9 in total including the one the avatar is on).The other tiles making up the room are hidden. This I deemed view radius 1. For view radius 2, I wanted the char to see radius 1 squares plus all the tiles adjacent to those tiles. At the time I could not figure out how to do it with a for loop so I just implemented a simpler scheme.
I feel this visibility function could be written recursively but I am having a hard time coming up with a base case and what my recursive step would be. My for loop just took avatar pos and iterated over a range to avatar pos + radius and I did that for the x,y coordinates.
As far as translating this over to a recursive function I am really confused. I have done many searches trying to get a lead but only come up with complicated subjects such as: FOV using recursive shadowcasting which is way beyond me.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.","  I know I should have thought up some help, but how can I do this for an entire loop?

62,"I'm working on a suite of tests using selenium webdriver (written in Python).  The page being tested contains a form that changes its displayed fields based upon what value is selected in one of its select boxes.  This select box has about 250 options.  I have a test (running via nose, though that's probably irrelevant) that iterates through all the options in the select box, verifying that the form has the correct fields displayed for each selected option.
The problem is that for each option, it calls through selenium:

click for the option to choose
find_element and is_displayed for 7 fields
find_elements for the items in the select box
get_attribute and text for each option in the select box

So that comes out to (roughly) 250 * (7 * 2 + 1 + 2 * 250), or 128,750 distinct requests to the webdriver server the test is running on, all within about 10 or 15 minutes.  This is leading to client port exhaustion on the machine running the test in some instances.  This is all running through a test framework that abstracts away things like how the select box is parsed, when new page objects are created, and a few other things, so optimizations in the test code either mean hacking that all to hell or throwing away the framework for this test and doing everything manually (which, for maintainability of our test code, is a bad idea).
Some ideas I've had for solutions are:

Trying to somehow pool or reuse the connection to the webdriver server
Somehow tweaking the configuration of urllib2 or httplib at runtime so that the connections opened by selenium timeout or are killed more quickly
System independent (or at least implementable for all systems with an OS switch or some such) mechanism for actively tracking and closing the ports being opened by selenium

As I mentioned above, I can't do much to tweak the way the page is parsed or handled, but I do have control over subclassing/tweaking WebDriver or RemoteConnection any way I please.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach any of the above ideas, or any ideas that I haven't come up with?","  It might be possible to add a custom response element to my test page as well.

In my current scenario, I've majority of work being done in Java, however the Natural Language Processing(NLP)/Machine Learning(ML) part is being done in Python using the NLTK, Scipy, Numpy etc libraries. I'm trying to use the services of this Python engine in existing Java code. Integrating the Python code to Java through something like Jython is not that straight-forward(as Jython does not support calling any python module which has C based extensions, as far as I know), So I thought the next option would be to make it a web service, similar to what I had done with Java web services in the past. Now comes the actual crux of the question, how do I run the ML engine as a web service and call the same from any platform, in my current scenario this happens to be Java. I tried looking in the web, for various options to achieve this and found things like CherryPy, Werkzeug etc but not able to find the right approach or any sample code or anything that shows how to invoke a NLTK-Python script and serve the result through web, and eventually replicating the functionality Java web service provides. In the Python-NLTK code, the ML engine does a data-training on a large corpus(this takes 3-4 minutes) and we don't want the Python code to go through this step every time a method is invoked. If I make it a web service, the data-training will happen only once, when the service starts and then the service is ready to be invoked and use the already trained engine. 
Now coming back to the problem, I'm pretty new to this web service things in Python and would appreciate any pointers on how to achieve this .Also, any pointers on achieving the goal of calling NLTK based python scripts from Java, without using web services approach and which can deployed on production servers to give good performance would also be helpful and appreciable.

26,"I want to create an application that is capable of loading plugins. The twist is that I want to be able to create plugins in both C/C++ and Python.
So I've started thinking about this and have a few questions that I'm hoping people can help me with.
My first question is whether I need to use C/C++ for the ""core"" of the application (the part that actually does the loading of the plugins)? This is my feeling at least, I would think that implementing the core in Python would result in a nasty performance hit, but it would probably simplify loading the plugins dynamically.
Second question is how would I go about defining the plugin interface for C/C++ on one hand and Python on the other? The plugin interface would be rather simple, just a single method that accepts a list of image as a parameter and returns a list of images as a return value. I will probably use the OpenCV image type within the plugins which exists for both C/C++ and Python.
Finally, I would like the application to dynamically discover plugins. So if you place either a .py file or a shared library file (.so/.dll) in this directory, the application would be able to produce a list of available plugins at runtime.
I found something in the Boost library called Boost.Extension (http://boost-extension.redshoelace.com/docs/boost/extension/index.html) but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be a part of the official Boost library and it also seems to be a bit stale now. On top of that, I don't know how well it would work with Python, that is, how easy it would be to create Python plugins that fit into this mechanism.
As a side note, I imagine the application split into two ""parts"". One part is a stripped down core (loading and invoking plugin instances from a ""recipe""). The other part is the core plus a GUI that I plan on writing in Python (using PySide). This GUI will enable the user to define the aforementioned ""recipes"". This GUI part would require the core to be able to provide a list of available plugins.
Sorry for the long winded ""question"". I guess I'm hoping for more of a discussion and of course if anybody knows of something similar that would help me I would very much appreciate a pointer. I would also appreciate any concise and to the point reading material about something similar (such as integrating C/C++ and Python etc).","

35,"I'm creating a website that allows players to queue to find similarly skilled players for a multiplayer video game. Simple web backends only modify a database and create a response using a template, but in addition to that, my backend has to:

Communicate with players in real-time (via gevent-socketio) while they queue or play
Run calculations in the background to find balanced games, slowly compromising game quality as waiting time grows (and inform players via SocketIO when a game has been found)
Monitor in progress games via a UDP socket (and if a player disconnects, ask the queue for a substitute) and eventually update the database with the results

I know how I would do these things individually, but I'm wondering how I should separate these components and let them communicate. I imagine that my web framework (Flask) shouldn't be very involved at all in these other things.
Since I already must use gevent, I'm currently planning to start separate greenlets for each of these tasks. This will work for all my tasks (with the possible exception of the calculations) because they will usually be waiting for something to happen. However, this won't scale at all because I can't run more Flask instances. Everything would be dependent on the greenlets running in just a single thread.

36,"I'm developing a Python-application that ""talks"" to the user, and performs tasks based on what the user says(e.g. User:""Do I have any new facebook-messages?"", answer:""Yes, you have 2 new messages. Would you like to see them?""). Functionality like integration with facebook or twitter is provided by plugins. Based on predefined parsing rules, my application calls the plugin with the parsed arguments, and uses it's response. The application needs to be able to answer multiple query's from different users at the same time(or practically the same time).
Currently, I need to call a function, ""Respond"", with the user input as argument. This has some disadvantages, however:
i)The application can only ""speak when it is spoken to"". It can't decide to query facebook for new messages, and tell the user whether it does, without being told to do that.
ii)Having a conversation with multiple users at a time is very hard, because the application can only do one thing at a time: if Alice asks the application to check her Facebook for new messages, Bob can't communicate with the application.
iii)I can't develop(and use) plugins that take a lot of time to complete, e.g. download a movie, because the application isn't able to do anything whilesame the previous task isn't completed.
Multithreading seems like the obvious way to go, here, but I'm worried that creating and using 500 threads at a time dramatically impacts performance, so using one thread per query(a query is a statement from the user) doesn' seem like the right option.

42,"Summary: is there a race condition in Django sessions, and how do I prevent it?
I have an interesting problem with Django sessions which I think involves a race condition due to simultaneous requests by the same user.
It has occured in a script for uploading several files at the same time, being tested on localhost. I think this makes simultaneous requests from the same user quite likely (low response times due to localhost, long requests due to file uploads). It's still possible for normal requests outside localhost though, just less likely.
I am sending several (file post) requests that I think do this:

Django automatically retrieves the user's session*
Unrelated code that takes some time
Get request.session['files'] (a dictionary)
Append data about the current file to the dictionary
Store the dictionary in request.session['files'] again
Check that it has indeed been stored
More unrelated code that takes time
Django automatically stores the user's session

Here the check at 6. will indicate that the information has indeed been stored in the session. However, future requests indicate that sometimes it has, sometimes it has not.
What I think is happening is that two of these requests (A and B) happen simultaneously. Request A retrieves request.session['files'] first, then B does the same, changes it and stores it. When A finally finishes, it overwrites the session changes by B.
Two questions:

Is this indeed what is happening? Is the django development server multithreaded? On Google I'm finding pages about making it multithreaded, suggesting that by default it is not? Otherwise, what could be the problem?
If this race condition is the problem, what would be the best way to solve it? It's an inconvenience but not a security concern, so I'd already be happy if the chance can be decreased significantly.

Retrieving the session data right before the changes and saving it right after should decrease the chance significantly I think. However I have not found a way to do this for the request.session, only working around it using django.contrib.sessions.backends.db.SessionStore. However I figure that if I change it that way, Django will just overwrite it with request.session at the end of the request. 
So I need a request.session.reload() and request.session.commit(), basically.","his can only be used for single-user sessions and the Django docs explain it so that there is no need to add it in. The same goes for non-session objects. So if you have a User object and a Session object, you want to call the getSession method to get session information.

prompt me to enter a name of a song
copy that name
open a web browser (google chrome for example)
paste that name in the address bar and find information about the song
open a page that contains the lyrics
copy that lyrics
run a text editor (like Microsoft Word for instance)
paste the lyrics
save the new text file with the name of the song

I am not asking for code, of course. I just want to know the concepts or ideas about how to use python to interact with other programs
To be more specific, I think I want to know, fox example, just how we point out where is the address bar in Google Chrome and tell python to paste the name there. Or how we tell python how to copy the lyrics as well as paste it into the Microsof Word's sheet then save it.
I've been reading (I'm still reading) several books on Python: Byte of python, Learn python the hard way, Python for dummies, Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame. However, I found out that it seems like I only (or almost only) learn to creat programs that work on itself (I can't tell my program to do things I want with other programs that are already installed on my computer)
I know that my question somehow sounds rather silly, but I really want to know how it works, the way we tell Python to regconize that this part of the Google chrome browser is the address bar and that it should paste the name of the song in it. The whole idea of making python interact with another program is really really vague to me and I just 
extremely want to grasp that.

First you should create a table for each images query, so that you can get the ID and the name of the database-related field of each view (this way you could store only the key image, or the last of those if you need to create the queried database).

93,"I have a C++ application from Windows that I wish to port across to run on a Red Hat Linux system.  This application embeds a slightly modified version of Python 2.7.3 (I added the Py_SetPath command as it is essential for my use case) so I definitely need to compile the Python source.
My problem is that despite looking, I can't actually find any guidance on how to get Python to emit the right files for me to link against and how to then get g++ to link my C++ code against it in such a way that I don't need to have an installed copy of Python on every system I distribute this to.

how do I compile Python so that it can be embedded into the C++ app on Linux?
what am I linking against for the C++ app to work?

95,"The Situation
Alright, so we have our app in appengine with full text search activated. We had an index set on a document with a field named 'date'. This field is a DateField and now we changed the model of the document so the field 'date' is now a NumericField. 
The problem is, on the production server, even if I cleared all the document from the index, the server responds with this type of error: Failed to parse search request """"; SortSpec numeric default value does not match expression type 'TEXT' in 'date'
The Solution
The problem is, ""I think"", the fact that the model on the server doesn't fit the model of the search query. So basically, one way to do it, would be to delete the whole index, but I don't know how to do it on the production server.
The dev server works flawlessly","  http://www.el-project.org/issues/1428/showup/2013/11/view.php#11

11,"In Celery, the only way to conclusively reload modules is to restart all of your celery processes.  I know how to remotely shutdown workers (broadcast('shutdown', destination = [<workers>])), but not how to bring them back up.  
I have a piece of Python code that works to create a daemon process with a new worker in it, but when I try to run it inside Celery as a celery task, I get AssertionError: daemonic processes are not allowed to have children, which I'm guessing is related to the way that the worker pool is set up.  

Is there a way to override this error in Celery somehow?  
If not, is there another way to get Celery to start up another worker to replace itself with?  Maybe wrap this whole thing in a bash script (though the point of doing this in Python was to avoid using Python to call bash to call Python).  
If not, is there another way to convince Celery to reload the newest version of the code?  the --autoreload flag and broadcast('pool_restart') both do nothing.  

Example Behavior:

Create:
@task
def add(x,y):
    return x+y
Load up celery, run add.delay(4,4), get back 8.  
Change add to:
@task
def add(x,y):
    return x*y
Do magic (currently ""Restart Celery"")
Run add.delay(4,4) again

You should get back 16.

21,"Need a way to indicate/enforce that certain methods can only be done on the root Node of my tree data structure.  I'm working in Python 2.x
I have a class, Node, which I use in conjunction with another class, Edge, to build a tree data structure (edges are letters and nodes are words, in this case).
Some methods in Node are needed for every instance of the Node, like get_word, which runs backwards through the tree to determine the word being represented by that Node.  But other Node operations, like load_word_into_tree, seem more like a class methods -- they operate on the entire tree.  Furthermore, the way I have structured the that call, it requires the root node and the root node only as its input.  If it is called on any other node, it'll totally mess up the tree.
I see two options:

Make load_word_into_tree an instance method, but raise an error if it is called on any Node that isn't the root.  I'm leaning towards this, but something just seems not right about it.  In my mind, instance methods are methods that every instance should need, and to have this method tacked on to every Node when it can only ever be used for the root seems like a waste.
Make load_word_into_tree a class method, but pass it the root node as an arg.  This gets around the problem of a 'wasteful' instance method, but also seems like a misuse of concept of a class method, since it takes a single node as its input.  Furthermore, I'm not sure what use I'd have for the required cls variable available to every class method.

We are using a dSpace 1103 out of Simulink/Matlab and ControlDesk.
What I would like to know is, is it possible to use python in ControlDesk to transfer data into the dSpace from network? I mean, write an UDP Listener in python and use that script to update variables inside the Simulink/Matlab model?
Or is there any other good chance to transfer data from a program into ControlDesk such that the changes are send to dSpace?
Another question is, how long does it normally take if I change a variable in ControlDesk that the change is done inside dSpace (1-2 ms)??
Is this completely stochastic or more or less a constant value?

28,"Yesterday, I edited the bin/activate script of my virtualenv so that it sets the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include a development version of some external package. I had to do this because the setup.py of the package uses distutils and does not support the develop command à la setuptools. Setting PYTHONPATH works fine as far as using the Python interpreter in the terminal is concerned.
However, just now I opened the project settings in PyCharm and discovered that PyCharm is unaware of the external package in question - PyCharm lists neither the external package nor its path. Naturally, that's because PyCharm does not (and cannot reliably) parse or source the bin/activate script. I could manually add the path in the PyCharm project settings, but that means I have to repeat myself (once in bin/activate, and again in the PyCharm project settings). That's not DRY and that's bad.
Creating, in site-packages, a symlink that points to the external package is almost perfect. This way, at least the source editor of PyCharm can find the package and so does the Python interpreter in the terminal. However, somehow PyCharm still does not list the package in the project settings and I'm not sure if it's ok to leave it like that.
So how can I add the external package to my virtualenv/project in such a way that…

I don't have to repeat myself; and…
both the Python interpreter and PyCharm would be aware of it?","  :)

What kind of network should I use? The two I can think of that could work are simple feed-forward networks and Hopfield networks. Since I also want to know how much the input looks like the target, Hopfield nets are probably not suitable.
If I use something that requires supervised learning and I only want one output unit that indicates how much the input looks like the target, what counter-examples should I show it during the training process? Just giving it positive examples I'm pretty sure won't work (the network will just learn to always say 'yes').

The images are going to be low resolution and black and white."," __________________

However, I need to use Python in the later stages of the project and consequently need to decrypt my data using it. I tried employing PyCrypto but it tells me the key length must be 16, 24 or 32 bytes long, which is not the case.

I've read elsewhere about a django flatpages app which stores html pages in a database, but it seems like static html pages are best stored on a filesystem like S3, no?

Let's say I have this file: function.py, a function in this file will accept a new amount of money and increase the appropriate balance in the database. 
When someone tries to post data to this file, and this person is outside the server (lets say from 244.23.23.0) the file will be in-accessible. Whereas, calling the function from the server itself will be accepted. 
So files can access other files on the server, but external users cannot, with the result that no one can execute this file unless it's called from the server.
This is really important to me, because it's related to real money. Also, the money will come from PayPal IPN. And actually, if there was a way to prevent access unless it was coming from PayPal, that would be an amazing way to secure the app.

Put the database in a cloud SQL using Google [https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/]

I have put together the sensors, and have these connected to the Raspberry. I have also the Python code, so I can read the sensors.  I have a webpage up and running on the Diskstation using Python. But how do I get the data from the  rasp to the Diskstation. The reading is just done, when the webpage is displayed.
Guess some kind of WebServices on the Rasp ? I have looked at Pyro4, but doesn't look like it can be installed at the Diskstation. And I would prefer not to install a whole WebServer Framework on the rasp.
Do you have a suggestion ?","nswer:

8,"I am searching for month now and growing quite frustrated.
I just love python. 
So after doing a lot of console based stuff I wanted to do some graphical UIs as well.
I am aware of most of the frameworks (wxpython, glade, tk etc).
But: I do not want to write the code for the GUI itself per hand! Declaring every element from hand, thinking about grids and doing a trail and error to find out just how many pixels you have to move an object to get it in the right place. Well, lets say that just sounds like 1990's to me, and it is no fun at all.
So to put it plain and simple, what I am looking for is a solution that allows me to design a GUI graphically (WYSIWYG) and have an event based linking to python code.
Almost all major languages have that: For C/C++ their are certainly the most IDEs/tools that can do that. For Java there is Netbeans with Wwing (example of what i want; it would be ideal if that UI designer in Netbeans could spit out jython code, but no: python is supported but not UIdesign). Even Mono/Visual Basic etc. has tools like that.
So why the hell is their nothing for python?
P.S. And please, no comments like ""If you are are real programmer you do it by hand to get cleaner code"". If I want something very specific I edit it by hand, but designing a standard UI by hand is a waste of time.","  My only suggestion would probably be to work around those issues by yourself with the framework, make a better project, etc...
Hope that helps.

I have a Python script that can execute a single test and handles time limits and collection of test results, and a handful of Jenkins jobs that run this Python script with different args. When I run this script from the command line, it works fine. But when I run the script via Jenkins (with the exact same arguments) the test times out. The script handles killing the test, so control is returned all the way back to Jenkins and everything is cleaned up. How can I debug this?

13,"I'd like to do somehow the contrary to what a template is used for: I want to write templates and programmatically derive a representation of the different tags and placeholders present in the template, to ultimately generate a form.
To put it another way, when you usually have the data and populate the template with it, I want to have the template and ask the user the right data to fill it.
Example (with pseudo-syntax): Hello {{ name_of_entity only-in ['World', 'Universe', 'Stackoverflow'] }}!
With that I could programatically derive that I should generate a form with a select tag named 'name_of_entity' and having 3 options ('World', 'Universe', 'Stackoverflow').
I looked into Jinja2, and it seems I can reach my goal using it and extending it (even if it's made to do things the other way). But I am still unsure how I should do in some cases, eg.:

if I want to represent that {{ weekday }} has values only in ['Mo', 'Tu', ...]
if I want to represent in the template that the {{ amount }} variable is accepting only integers...

Is Jinja a good base to reach these goals? If yes, how would you recommend to do that?","

The limitation I've found is that the Table.create method blocks if there is anything pending in the current transaction. I have to commit the transaction right before the .create call or it will block. It doesn't appear to be blocked in Sqlalchemy because you can't Ctrl-C it. You have to kill the process.

I've read in other answers that CREATE TABLE is transactional and can be rolled back, so I'm presuming this should be working. I've tried starting a new transaction with the current engine and using that for the table create (vs. the current Flask one) but that hasn't helped either.

31,"This has probably been asked before, but I don't know how to look up the answer, because I'm not sure what's a good way to phrase the question.
The topic is function arguments that can semantically be expressed in many different ways. For example, to give a file to a function, you could either give the file directly, or you could give a string, which is the path to the file. To specify a number, you might allow an integer as an argument, or maybe you might allow a string (the numeral), or you might even allow a string such as ""one"". Another example might be a function that takes a list (of numbers, say), but as a convenience, it will convert a number into a list containing one element: that number.
Is there a more or less standard approach in Python to allowing this sort of flexibility? It certainly complicates the code for a program if you're not certain what types the arguments are, so my guess would be to try factor out the convenience functions into just one place, instead of scattered everywhere, but I don't really know how best to do that kind of factoring.","

Your best bet for this would probably be to replace the decoded image by a JPG file. Then, you could write a.decoded extension that looks like the following (assuming you have been using gimp).

I don't know for sure that this is a PyCharm issue, but that's my best guess. Here's a description:

However, when I use the ""Run"" control to start the app, with no other changes, webpages do not automatically refresh. In that same scenario, when I navigate back to A, the old version of that webpage appears. I need to click my browser's Refresh control to see the updated page.
Please tell me how to stop the browser from displaying cached pages in Run mode. I haven't tried publishing this to our GAE website yet, and hopefully it won't happen there, but I need Run mode for performance on the video tutorial I'm creating.

goal
To store the master key in a form that can be deciphered (or read) only by my program. 
other things

there is an option for the user to change the master key.
The master key will be read and deciphered only once. At the start of the program. It will be stored in a variable then and and used from this variable. 
It is a GUI application. And I am using python Tkinter. 

details
Please note that the data is stored using another encryption that is not un breakable but enough for this kind of information. 
I have not used any database to store the information.

In my system, there are many plugins contributed by different people that may not know each other. If I allow them to define their error codes. It's mostly like error code of two plugins may conflict.
================================================================================================
I want to design an extendable error codes system that allows plugins to define their own error codes.
The basic idea is:

system has a range of reserved error codes
plugin can select a range that not used by system, then creates its error codes in that range. However, the problem is plugins don't know each other(because plugins may be written by different people and installed into system by user's preference). so their error codes range may conflict.

Is there any good practice for this requirement? I google a lot but to my surprise, there are very few  articles talking about designing error codes in production software. Most posts are focus on exception vs error code.
And, is there any good pattern for showing error in product that user could figure out what's going on?
My basic idea is to show user an error which has error code, descriptions, details. And user could click the error code then I would show him the proper solution","  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ErrorCodes#Resolving-the-error-code

62,"I have a program that displays many tkinter PhotoImages at once (relevant: I'm not using PIL). It currently has several screens, and when the play gets to the edge it loads a new tilemap, creating a bunch more photoimages in the currentTiles array after clearing the old contents.

The weird thing is that when I print the contents of the last item in the array after the loadLevel function is called, it says things such as ""pyimage3761"", and it increments each time I load a new screen. Is this due to tkinter keeping track of how many have been created so far, or is it because the old tiles are still in memory?

64,"Something that I just thought about:
Say I'm writing view code for my Django site, and I make a mistake and create an infinite loop.
Whenever someone would try to access the view, the worker assigned to the request (be it a Gevent worker or a Python thread) would stay in a loop indefinitely.
If I understand correctly, the server would send a timeout error to the client after 30 seconds. But what will happen with the Python worker? Will it keep on working indefinitely? That sounds dangerous!
Imagine I've got a server in which I've allocated 10 workers. I let it run and at some point, a client tries to access the view with the infinite loop. A worker will be assigned to it, and will be effectively dead until the next server restart. The dangerous thing is that at first I wouldn't notice it, because the site would just be imperceptibly slower, having 9 workers instead of 10. But then it might happen again and again throughout a long span of time, maybe months. The site would just get progressively slower, until eventually it would be really slow with just one worker.
A server restart would solve the problem, but I'd hate to have my site's functionality depend on server restarts.
Is this a real problem that happens? Is there a way to avoid it?
Update: I'd also really appreciate a way to take a stacktrace of the thread/worker that's stuck in an infinite loop, so I could have that emailed to me so I'll be aware of the problem. (I don't know how to do this because there is no exception being raised.)
Update to people saying things to the effect of ""Avoid writing code that has infinite loops"": In case it wasn't obvious, I do not spend my free time intentionally putting infinite loops into my code. When these things happen, they are mistakes, and mistakes can be minimized but never completely avoided. I want to know that even when I make a mistake, there'll be a safety net that will notify me and allow me to fix the problem.","

78,"I am not sure if this question belongs here as it may be a little to broad. If so, I apologize. Anyway, I am planning to start a project in python and I am trying to figure out how best to implement it, or if it is even possible in any practical way. The system will consist of several ""nodes"" that are essentially python scripts that translate other protocols for talking to different kinds of hardware related to i/o, relays to control stuff, inputs to measure things, rfid-readers etc, to a common protocol for my system. I am no programming or network expert, but this part I can handle, I have a module from an old alarm system that uses rs-485 that I can sucessfully control and read. I want to get the nodes talking to eachother over the network so I can distribute them to different locations (on the same subnet for now). The obvious way would be to use a server that they all connect to so they can be polled and get orders to flip outputs or do something else. This should not be too hard using twisted or something like it. 
The problem with this is that if this server for some reason stops working, everything else does too. I guess what I would like is some kind of serverless communication, that has no single point of failure besides the network itself. Message brokers all seem to require some kind of server, and I can not really find anything else that seems suitable for this. All nodes must know the status of all other nodes as I will need to be able to make functions based on the status of things connected to other nodes, such as, do not open this door if that door is already open. Maybe this could be done by multicast or broadcast, but that seems a bit insecure and just not right. One way I thought of could be to somehow appoint one of the nodes to accept connections from the other nodes and act as a message router and arrange for some kind of backup so that if this node crashes or goes away, another predetermined node takes over and the other nodes connect to it instead. This seems complicated and I am not sure this is any better than just using a message broker.
As I said, I am not sure this is an appropriate question here but if anyone could give me a hint to how this could be done or if there is something that does something similar to this that I can study. If I am beeing stupid, please let me know that too :)","nThanks.

[ mainWindow ] --> (1) mainOverview (gtkVbox) --> (2A) mainContent (gtkHbox) ... other non-related content

3,"I need to represent instances of Python ""Long integer"" in MySQL. I wonder what the most appropriate SQL data type I should use.
The Python documentation (v2.7) says (for numbers.Integral):

Long integers

These represent numbers in an unlimited range, subject to available (virtual) memory only. For the purpose of shift and mask operations, a binary representation is assumed, and negative numbers are represented in a variant of 2’s complement which gives the illusion of an infinite string of sign bits extending to the left.


My read of the MySQL documentation suggests that BIGINT is limited to 64 bits. The DECIMAL type seems to be limited to 65 digits. I can, of course, use BLOB.
The application needs to support very large amounts of data, but I don't know yet how big these long integers might get, nor how many of them I'm likely to see.

Prior to Python my web programming experience was in PHP (several years worth) and I'm afraid that my PHP experience is misleading some of my Python work.

So I need to manage those connections, and ensure that I close them. Also, I need to have some kind of connection pool, because if I have just one connection shared across all requests, then requests could block waiting on DB access, if I don't have enough connections available.
Is this a correct understanding? Or have I identified the differences well? In a Python web app, do I need to have a DB connection pool that shares its connections across many requests? And the number of connections in the pool will depend on my application's request load?

A:
1) You want to create an empty directory and then cd to the folder in the ""default_zoom"" folder. That will work. So your ""sudo"" command will create a new directory named ""./zvm_directory"" and make sure that this directory is empty, then reboot into your directory. Or if your current folder doesn't have a home folder you could just edit your dir to work around this issue.

15,"I'm developing on GAE-Python 2.7 using Eclipse+PyDev as IDE. Since GAE SDK 1.7.6 (March 2013), where Google ""broke"" support for breakpoints*, I've been using the old dev server to continue debugging the application I'm working on. 
However, Google will drop support of the old dev server as of July 2013 and, since I do not expect a prompt solution for this on PyDev (I've seen no activity so far about this), I would like to look for an alternative IDE to still being able to do debugging. 
I know that one of the possible options is to go for PyCharm (initial license of 89€+VAT and 59€+VAT each year to continue receiving upgrades), but I would like to know how other people is (will be) addressing this problem and what are the current alternatives to PyCharm
*I would like to clarify the sentence ""Google broke support for breakpoints"": In SDK 1.7.6+, Google started using stdin/stdout in the new dev server for doing IPC and this leaves no chances to even do debugging with pdb. Google claims that they have created the hooks for tool vendors to support debugging (as PyCharm did) but, in my opinion, they ""broke"" debugging by forcing people to move away from the IDE they were initially recommending due to an architectural decision (I'm not an expert, but they could have used the native IPC mechanisms included in Python instead of using stdin/stdout). 
EDIT:
I forgot to mention that I'm running Eclipse+Pydev for MacOSX, so please, also mention your OS compatibility in your alternatives/solutions.","  (You'll need Pycharm and CVS to keep your answer short.)

18,"I have been researching RBMs for a couple months, using Python along the way, and have read all your papers. I am having a problem, and I thought, what the hey? Why not go to the source? I thought I would at least take the chance you may have time to reply.
My question is regarding the Log-Likelihood in a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. I have read that finding the exact log-likelihood in all but very small models is intractable, hence the introduction of contrastive divergence, PCD, pseudo log-likelihood etc. My question is, how do you find the exact log-likelihood in even a small model? 
I have come across several definitions of this formula, and all seem to be different. In Tielemen’s 2008 paper “Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines using Approximations To the Likelihood Gradient”, he performs a log-likelihood version of the test to compare to the other types of approximations, but does not say the formula he used. The closest thing I can find is the probabilities using the energy function over the partition function, but I have not been able to code this, as I don’t completely understand the syntax.
In Bengio et al “Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives”, the equation for the log-likelihood is:
 sum_t=1 to T (log P(X^T, theta)) 
which is equal to sum_t=1 to T(log * sum_h in {0,1}^d_h(P(x^(t), h; theta))
 where T is training examples. This is (14) on page 11. 
The only problem is that none of the other variables are defined. I assume x is the training data instance, but what is the superscript (t)? I also assume theta are the latent variables h, W, v… But how do you translate this into code?
I guess what I’m asking is can you give me a code (Python, pseudo-code, or any language) algorithm for finding the log-likelihood of a given model so I can understand what the variables stand for? That way, in simple cases, I can find the exact log-likelihood and then compare them to my approximations to see how well my approximations really are.","If you are a webmaster, please respond.

My problem is quite simple : I'm trying to compute an oblic profile of an image using scipy.
One great way to do it is to :

extract the minimal image containing the segment, 
compute the angle from which my image should be rotated to get the desired profile along a nice raw, 
extract said raw.

49,"Simple question, but I've tried a few things and nothing seems to work.
I want to overlay some statistics onto a 3d VTK scene, using 2D vtkTextActors. This works fine, but the text is at times difficult to see, depending on what appears behind it in the 3D scene.
For this reason, I'd like to add a 2d, semi-transparent ""box"" behind my text actors to provide a darker background.
Which VTK object is appropriate for this? I've tried so far:

vtkLegendBoxActor: Not what I want, but I can use this with no text to display a semi-transparent box on screen. I cannot size it directly and I get warnings about not initialising some of the content.
vtkImageData: Tried manually creating image data and adding it to the scene; I believe it was placed within the 3d scene and not used as an overlay. If that's not the case then I couldn't get it to show at all.
vtkCornerAnnotation: Scales with window size, is fixed to a corner and the background opacity cannot be set AFAIK.
vtkTextActor: Cannot set a background color or opacity

Can anyone tell me how they might achieve what I'm after in VTK?","

I can validate an Access Point with SSID exists by parsing the output of a iwlist scan subprocess. Validating the Passphrase, however, is less straight forward. So far, the only solution I've come up with is to parse the output of 

wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf

Interpreting a handshake timeout as an invalid Passphrase seems plain wrong. Besides that, that approach requires waiting for some output from a subprocess and assumes the absence of error messages means the Passphrase is valid.

54,"I know that many large-scale applications such as video games are created using multiple langages. For example, it's likely the game/physics engines are written in C++ while gameplay tasks, GUI are written in something like Python or Lua. 
I understand why this division of roles is done; use lower-level languages for tasks that require extreme optimization, tweaking, efficiency and speed, while using higher-level languages to speed up production time, reduce nasty bugs ect.
Recently, I've decided to undertake a larger personal project and would like to divy-up parts of the project similar to above. At this point in time, I'm really confused about how this interoperability between languages (especially compiled vs interpreted) works. 
I'm quite familiar with the details of going from ANSCII code test to loading an executable, when written in something like C/C++. I'm very curious at how something like a video game, built from many different languages, works. This is a large/broad question, but specifically I'm interested in:

How does the code-level logic work? I.e. how can I call Python code from a C++ program? Especially since they don't support the same built-in types?
What does the program image look like? From what I can tell, a video game is running in a single process, so what does the runtime image look like when running a C/C++ program that calls a Python function?
If calling code from an interpreted language from a compiled program, what are the sequence of events that occur? I.e If I'm inside my compiled executable, and for some reason have a call to an interpreted language inside a loop, do I have to wait for the interpreter every iteration?

I'm actually finding a hard time finding information on what happening at the machine-level, so any help would be appreciated. Although I'm curious in general about interoperation of software, I'm specifically interested in C++ and Python interaction.
Thank you very much for any insight, even if it's just pointing me to where I can find more information.","

If you have a way of writing an analysis that takes more data than a single file in a folder, then the above question applies.

I'm testing a load balancer using a small Django app. This app is listening on a number of different IPs and I need to know which IP address is hit for a request coming through the load balancer, so I can ensure it is balancing properly.
I cannot use request.get_host() or the request.META options, as they return what the user typed to hit the load balancer.
For example: the user hits http://10.10.10.10/foo and that will forward the request to either http://10.0.0.1/foo or http://10.0.0.2/foo - but request.get_host() will return 10.10.10.10, not the actual IPs the server is listening on.

73,"I am in the midst of writing a web app in CherryPy.  I have set it up so that it uses OpenID auth, and can successfully get user's ID/email address.
I would like to have it set so that whenever a page loads, it checks to see if the user is logged in, and if so displays some information about their login.
As I see it, the basic workflow should be like this:

Is there a userid stored in the current session?  If so, we're golden.
If not, does the user have cookies with a userid and login token? If so, process them, invalidate the current token and assign a new one, and add the user information to the session.  Once again, we're good.
If neither condition holds, display a ""Login"" link directing to my OpenID form.

Obviously, I could just include code (or a decorator) in every public page that would handle this.  But that seems very... irritating.
I could also set up a default index method in each class, which would do this and then use a (page-by-page) helper method to display the rest of the content.  But this seems like a nightmare when it comes to the occasional exposed method other than index.
So, my hope is this: is there a way in CherryPy to set some code to be run whenever a request is received?  If so, I could use this to have it set up so that the current session always includes all the information I need.
Alternatively, is it safe to create a wrapper around the cherrypy.expose decorator, so that every exposed page also runs this code?
Or, failing either of those: I'm also open to suggestions of a different workflow.  I haven't written this kind of system before, and am always open to advice.

Edit: I have included an answer below on how to accomplish what I want.  However, if anybody has any workflow change suggestions, I would love the advice!  Thanks all.","

(if that makes sense) without going into a class and overriding the hash function and then passing that in.
Perhaps some form of data structure that stores regex keys and performs it on any valid input? - Whilst I could create one I'm wondering if there is some form of in-built function I'm missing (just so I don't reinvent the wheel)

92,"We have a large Django application made up of a large number of different views (some of which  contain forms). As with most large applications, we use a base layout template that contains the common layout elements across the applications (mainly a header and a footer), which the templates for all of our views extend.
What we are looking to do is create a universal search box in our application, accessible on every page, which allows users to perform searches across the entire application, and want to place the search box inside the header, which involves placing a form inside our base layout template. This means that every view in our application will need to be able to handle the submission of this search form. Once this search form is submitted, we will need to redirect the user to another view containing the search results.
However, we are struggling to come up with a pattern to handle this. Does anyone know of functionality built into Django that will help us to build this? Failing that, can anyone suggest a good strategy for modifying our application so that we can handle  this use-case without having to modify a large number of existing views (which we don't have the resources to do at the moment)?
Please note that the focus of this question is intended to be the best way to handle the submission of a form which appears in every view, and not strategies for implementing a universal search algorithm (which we have already figured out).

Our first idea was to create a base View class that implements handling the universal search form submission, and have each of our views extend this. However, this is not possible because we already have views that inherit from a number of different Django view classes (TemplateView, ListView, FormView and DeleteView being some examples), and to be able to build our own common view class would mean either writing our own version of these Django view classes to inherit from our own view base class, or re-writing a large number of our views so they don't use the Django view classes.
Our next idea was to implement a mixin that would handle the universal search form submission, in an attempt to add this functionality to all our views in a way that allows us to continue using the different Django view classes. However, this brought to light two new problems: (a) how could we do this without modifying each of our views to become a form view, and (b) how can we do this in a way that allows the form handling logic to play nicely when mixed in to existing FormViews?","ch model class?
We decided on the following:
1) We'll use an adapter to display the forms on each application page. To do so, our form classes need an abstract class called Form (as you can see above). If we had an interface for this, what would that type of form-based abstractity look like?",-0.4865,-0.0037223697,0.2330441921949386,0.4827776303,69,520

A:
1) If you want to include the module in your project, you have to enable the import module, but that won't work for your case if you are working on Python 2 with 2-5.

The transfer used a pretty simple Python script with Boto to connect to S3 and download the contents of each object.

23,"I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.
I am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one.
Also, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.
I find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).

A:
For simplicity, let me explain about multiprotocol. You can see my answer here.

 A thread is a program that uses a single thread, called thread. It runs multiple threads on its main thread (the first being the main) and processes these threads. In a case of multithreaded computation, a multistead job is executed as a result of the threads running on that thread and then processes it as multiple runs of that threads, creating a collection of threads to hold the result. 
Threads can be grouped into two main components, the number of runs and, for example, each thread has a name and will call the one calling the same thread on the last run.",-0.5654,-0.36175752,0.0414499230682849,0.20364248000000001,155,209

25,"I have a slight variant on the ""find k nearest neighbours"" algorithm which involves rejecting those that don't satisfy a certain condition and I can't think of how to do it efficiently. 
What I'm after is to find the k nearest neighbours that are in the current line of sight. Unfortunately scipy.spatial.cKDTree doesn't provide an option for searching with a filter to conditionally reject points.
The best algorithm I can come up with is to query for n nearest neighbours and if there aren't k that are in the line of sight then query it again for 2n nearest neighbours and repeat. Unfortunately this would mean recomputing the n nearest neighbours repeatedly in the worst cases. The performance hit gets worse the more times I have to repeat this query. On the other hand setting n too high is potentially wasteful if most of the points returned aren't needed.
The line of sight changes frequently so I can't recompute the cKDTree each time either. Any suggestions?","

company
company.packagename

import company
company.__path__
The installed paths are found, but not the current directory. What am I missing?

I would like to point out that the problem is Python cannot find any package under company because setuptools-installed packages define company as a namespace.

Django is just unhappy with namespaces. It seems there are no viable solutions.","

66,"I'm using TastyPie and Django to build out my backend for an application that will have browser and mobile (native iOS) clients.
I have been through the TastyPie and Django docs, can authenticate successfully either using the TastyPie resources I set up, or using Djangos built in views. I see a lot of examples on including the CSRF token on the page and grabbing it with your JavaScript, and that works, but I don't understand now to actually determine whether a user is logged in on initial page load (from JavaScript). 
Example:
If I want to serve static HTML from a separate, fast web server, and cache my application JavaScript, and only interact with Django through TastyPie views, how do I determine if the user is logged in (and know to render a login form or the app views using JavaScript), and after logout, is there any session information I need to remove from the client browser?
If I were to serve up HTML through Django's template engine, I could render the login form through there appropriately, but that seems not ideal if I want to truly decouple my JavaScript app from Django (and behave like a mobile client).
Edit: I am using Backbone.js, but I don't think that should matter.
UPDATE:
I think I figured it out reading through Django's CSRF documentation again.
If your view is not rendering a template containing the csrf_token template tag, Django might not set the CSRF token cookie. This is common in cases where forms are dynamically added to the page. To address this case, Django provides a view decorator which forces setting of the cookie: ensure_csrf_cookie().
If I do not want to render Django templates, this reads like I can still use the cookie and pull that into my Backbone or jQuery AJAX methods. I'm not sure if TastyPie ensures the cookie will be sent or how to tie into it.
If I use AJAX to logout, will the cookie automatically be removed or does it become invalid? Are these CSRF tokens unique to each user session? I'll have to test some things tomorrow with it. Is it possible to use Django decorators on TastyPie views?","  If I change the url attribute from AJAscript/Mojito/View, it will automatically work for a cookie token. Please note that if you have multiple user sessions and want it to be displayed on a single page, then this is a valid approach. 


Thanks!

A:

  The cookie is just a wrapper around the request object (the cookie), however, if there are multiple forms to view, they should be wrapped inside the <form> tag.

88,"I'm a freelance editor and tutor as well as a fiction writer and artist looking to transition to the latter on a full-time basis. Naturally, part of that transition involves constructing a website; a dynamic site to which new content in various forms can be added with ease. Now, I've always intended to learn how to program, and I simply haven't the money to hire someone else to do it. So, having had a good experience with my brief dabblings in Python, I decided I'd go with Django for building my site.
I set up a Fedora Virtualbox for a development environment (as I didn't want to jump through hoops to make Windows work) and went to town on some Django tutorials. Everything went swimmingly until life intervened and I didn't touch the project for three weeks. I'm in a position to return to it now, but I've realized two things in the process. First, I'm having to do a fair bit of retracing of my steps just to find where certain files are, and second, I don't know how I'd go about deploying the site after I'm done building it. My intention is to get the cheapest Linode and host off that until some theoretical point in the future where I required more.
I suspect that re: the file organization issue, that's just something I'll become more familiar with over time, though if there are any tricks I should be aware of to simplify the structure of my overall Django development space, I'm eager to know them. However, what about deployment? How viable is it to, with sufficient knowledge, automate the process of pushing the whole file structure of a site with Git? And how can I do that in such a way that it doesn't tamper with the settings of my development environment?","

In general, I would suggest a python program to do the tasks. Write a Qt widget as a gui (interactively changing views, putting numbers into tables, setting up check boxes, switching between various layers - never done something as complex in python, but some experience in IDL with event handling etc), set up data classes that have unctions, both to create the ascii files with the given convention, and to send the files via ftp to some remote server.

I am looking to run my code on a cluster as the quad-core architecture on my local machine doesn't seem to be doing the job. The documentation seems overwhelming and I don't even know which AWS services are going to be used for running my script on EC2. Would I have to use their storage facility (S3) because I guess if I have to run my script, I'm going to have to store it on the cloud in a place where the cluster instance has access to the files or do I upload my files somewhere else while working with EC2? If this is true is it possible for me to upload my entire directory which has all the contents of the files required by my application onto s3. Any guidance would be much appreciated. So I guess my question is do I have to use S3 to store my code in a place accessible by the cluster? If so is there an easy way to do it? Meaning I have only seen examples of creating buckets wherein one file can be transferred per bucket. Can you transfer an entire folder into a bucket? 
If we don't require to use S3 then which other service should I use to give the cluster access to my scripts to be executed?

70,"Sorry, but I really don't know what's the meaning of the defination of round in python 3.3.2 doc:

round(number[, ndigits])
  Return the floating point value number rounded to ndigits digits after the decimal point. If ndigits is omitted, it defaults to zero. Delegates to number.__round__(ndigits).
For the built-in types supporting round(), values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2). The return value is an integer if called with one argument, otherwise of the same type as number.

I don't know how come the multiple of 10 and pow.
After reading the following examples, I think round(number,n) works like:
if let number be 123.456, let n be 2

round will get two number:123.45 and 123.46
round compares abs(number-123.45) (0.006) and abs(number-123.46) (0.004),and chooses the smaller one.
so, 123.46 is the result.

and if let number be 123.455, let n be 2:

round will get two number:123.45 and 123.46
round compares abs(number-123.45) (0.005) and abs(number-123.46) (0.005). They are equal. So round checks the last digit of 123.45 and 123.46. The even one is the result.
so, the result is 123.46 

Am I right?
If not, could you offer a understandable version of values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits?","

91,"and thanks ahead of time.
I am relatively new to Linux and am using Ubuntu 12.04.3.  Basically, I've been messing around with some files trying to get Django to work.  Well, I though I should do another install of Python2.7 for some reason.  Stupidly, I manually installed it.  Now when I open the Python shell and do 'import django', it can't be found.
I just want to go back to using the Python that was on Ubuntu by default, or overwrite the one I installed manually with one using apt-get.  However, I am unable to figure out how to do this nor have I found a question that could help me.
Any help is much appreciated.  I've been working on this for 6 hours now...
--EDIT--
Ok well I'm just trying to go ahead and have the PYTHONPATH look in the right place. I've seen in other posts that you should do this in the ~/.profile file.  I went into that file and added this line
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
""import django"" is still coming up with ""no module found""
I tried doing ""import os"" and then ""os.environ[""PYTHONPATH""], which gave me:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File """", line 1, in 
   File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/UserDict.py"", line 23, in getitem
   raise KeyError(key)
KeyError: 'PYTHONPATH'
As far as I can tell, this means that I do not have a PYTHONPATH variable set, but I am unsure as to what I am doing wrong.
--ANOTHER EDIT--
As I am not a very reputable member, I am not allowed to answer my own question before 8 hours from my original question, so I am putting it as an update.
Hey guys, thank you all for the quick responses and helpful tips.  What I did was open a python shell and type:



sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')



and it worked!
I should have done this from the beginning instead of trying to overwrite my manual Python installation.

95,"I have a web frontend which uses data from a task that must be run frequently in bulk (which takes more time than I'd like to use PHP for). The data can be stored in a database so I was planning on writing a Java application to run the task and use the database as a middleman to get the results of this task accessible to the web. 
Problem is, a ""preview"" of this data is needed occasionally. IE, sometimes the user needs to request a sample of the data (which can be computed quickly) to be generated on cue. 
This presents a real problem for me, this preview IS more suited for a language like PHP even though it's essentially the same task. It's just two cases, in case A there are real jobs from many users to be done so the task takes a sufficiently long time to complete (longer than a PHP request can hold), in case B it's a baby job for just one user ran on the spot which could be completed in PHP without issue. 
I don't want to write this code twice, it would make maintenance a nightmare so I kind of need to pick a language and stick with it. The frontend is designed but not implemented so I have an oppertunity to write the site in PHP, Ruby or Python if need be. I know PHP, so I would only consider switching to Python or Ruby if one of those languages offered a solution to this problem. but I know so little about these languages that I really cannot begin to know if they offer a solution without learning them (which I don't have the time for atm).

0,"I'm investigating ways to add vagrant to my development environment. I do most of  my web development in python, and I'm interested in python-related specifics, however the question is more general.
I like the idea of having all development-related stuff isolated in virtual machine, but I haven't yet discovered an effective way to work with it. Basically, I see 3 ways to set it up:

Have all services (such as database server, MQ, etc) as well as an application under development to run in VM. Developer would ssh to VM and edit sources there, run app, tests, etc, all in an ssh terminal.
Same as 1), but edit sources on host machine in mapped directory with normal GUI editor. Run application and tests on vagrant via ssh. This seems to be most popular way to use vagrant.
Host only external services in VM. Install app dependencies into virtualenv on host machine and run app and tests from there. 

All of these approaches have their own flaws:

Developing in text console is just too inconvenient, and this is the show-stopper for me. While I'm experienced ViM user and could live with it, I can't recommend this approach to anyone used to work in any graphical IDE.
You can develop with your familiar tools, but you cannot use autocompletion, since all python libs are installed in VM. Your tracebacks will point to non-local files. You will not be able to open library sources in your editor, ctags will not work.
Losing most of ""isolation"" feature: you have to install all compilers, *-dev libraries yourself to install python dependencies and run an app. It is pretty easy on linux, but it might be much harder to set them all up on OSX and on Windows it is next to impossible I guess.

So, the question is: is there any remedy for problems of 2nd and 3rd approaches? More specifically, how is it possible to create an isolated and easily replicatable environment, and yet enjoy all the comfort of development on host machine?","

I have a list of ~5000 locations with latitude and longitude coordinates called A, and a separate subset of this list called B. I want to find all locations from A that are within n miles of any of the locations in B.

My current approach is to iterate through all locations in B, and request locations within n miles of each location, adding them to the list if they don't exist yet.

25,"I'm a newbie here, and much of what I have learned about django and python have come from this website.  Thank you all for being so helpful!  This is my first question post.
I've got 2 problems as I try to extend what I've learned from the Django tutorial (1.6) and try to get the Polls app to load via AJAX.  I want to use the main mysite app as a home page, and pull in content from other apps in the mysite project using ajax.  The tutorial doesn't really cover integrating content from different apps on a single page.
I have 2 ajax elements already working on the main mysite page (a ""trick or treat"" button that retrieves some silly text, and a small dns lookup form/button) but those are part of the mysite app, so all of the logic is handled using the mysite app urlconf, views and templates.
There is another div on the page which is for a ""Featured App"" that will get pulled in, also via ajax.  Basically, mysite.views builds a list of apps that have a 'ajaxFeaturedAppView', and then chooses one at random to display in the ""Featured App"" section on the mysite page. This is my novice attempt at decoupling the mysite app from the other apps as much as possible.
Problem 1)  The initial poll question and choices and vote button all appear correctly on page load, but the vote button just loads another poll question.  It should display poll results.
Problem 2)  The other ajax elements on the page get triggered when I hit the Vote button, also.  I think this is because the Vote button action triggers the document ready() event, which initializes the ajax elements.  But the other ajax elements don't do that; they do not trigger the document ready() event.
I think that it may be one problem with two symptoms, actually.  So, how do I get the vote button to not trigger a document ready event, and will that allow me to see the poll results?  Or am I doing something else wrong?  
EDIT: 
Okay, there were a few problems with that pieced-together code.  Thanks for the help.","  There's a button which does exactly what it sounds like, with the results page and my site's content.



A:
Your site has to be built with AJX (see jquery.ajAX) - to have that you need to set the onLoad method. It does not work like jQuery. There is also no way to find out what the current event is, although jQuery calls some of its own methods - and it's still far more efficient to do it this way than to check if the event has been triggered yet. Here's the jQuery plugin
$(function () {
  $('.polls-list').each( function() { //this code gets the content of your aform

  $(""form"").aje( ""setEvent"", { url: ""http://api.my.site/polling?sortBy='poll_order'"" });

Does someone know or can come up with a way to use pure Numpy arrays and functions to draw as well as fill colored polygons on top of a numpy array grid? 
This I think would take two steps:

The ability to fill the grid array with color values so that the
polygon filling could be written in one color, and the outline in
another one. What would be ideal and fastest for such a system, eg
tuples of rgb values, color name strings, etc?
The ability to draw and fill the inside of a polygon based on an
array of its pixel coordinates. Drawing the outline of it I think
should be pretty easy by just using the coordinates as indexes to
the grid array and setting them to the outline color values. More
difficult would be to fill the polygon. One way would be to iterate
through all pixel cell coordinates (or better yet only for the
neighboring cells of each polygon coordinate point) and test if its
coordinates are within the polygon pixel coordinates. I know there
are some simple inside-outside/biggerthan-smallerthan algorithms to
test for point in poly using regular Python, but for my purpose this
would be too slow and I am wondering if someone has the numpy skills
to set up such an advanced linked code using only the speed of the
numpy builtin functions to return True if a numpy pixel coordinate
is inside a polygon.
Lastly, if someone would know how to draw a line between two
pixel/grid/array coordinates by filling in all the cells in between
two pixels with a True or color value?

I know this is a tall order, but I was just curious to see if anyone would know. If so, then this could make for a pretty powerful and fast Numpy-based drawing library. In the end I would like to save the grid array as an image which is easy by passing it to PIL. 
I am aware that PIL and Aggdraw can do the polygon drawings and that this has been suggested in many similar posts, but they are not very effective when receiving a numpy array of xy polygon/line coordinates. The assumption here is that my polygon coordinates are already in a numpy array format and I want to avoid the overhead of having to copy them into lists for every drawing (when we're talking about thousands of polygons frequently). So the difference in this post is about how to fill a polygon using pure Numpy.",st of coordinates rather than passing the array back to another library like GIMP.

43,"I have a (large) directory CSV with columns [0:3] = Phone Number, Name, City, State.
I created a random sample of 20,000 entries, but it was, of course, weighted drastically to more populated states and cities.
How would I write a python code (using CSV or Pandas - I don't have linecache available) that would equally prioritize/weight each unique city and each state (individually, not as a pair), and also limit each unique city to 3 picks?

TRICKIER idea: How would I write a python code such that for each random line that gets picked, it checks whether that city has been picked before.  If that city has been picked before, it ignores it and picks a random line again, reducing the number of considered previous picks for that city by one.  So, say that it randomly picks San Antonio, which has been picked twice before.  The script ignores this pick, places it back into the list, reduces the number of currently considered previous San Antonio picks, then randomly chooses a line again.  IF it picks a line from San Antonio again, then it repeats the previous process, now reducing considered San Antonio picks to 0.  So it would have to pick San Antonio three times in a row to add another line from San Antonio.  For future picks, it would have to pick San Antonio four times in a row, plus one for each additional pick.
I don't know how well the second option would work to ""scatter"" my random picks - it's just an idea, and it looks like a fun way to learn more pythonese.  Any other ideas along the same line of thought would be greatly appreciated.  Insights into statistical sampling and sample scattering would also be welcome.","  Thanks.

Unfortunately Scrapys behavior is to execute my requests, one after another and queues the redirect response at the end of the queue.

How can I circumvent this behavior, so that a FormRequest is executed, and the redirect returned in the requests response is executed befor any new FormRequest?

I am learning python as my first scripting language hopefully for use down the line in a security position. Upon asking for ideas of scripts to help teach myself, someone suggested that I create one for user enumeration.The idea is simple, cat out the user names from /etc/passwd from an account that does NOT have sudo privileges and try to 'su' into those accounts using the one password that I have. A reverse brute force of sorts, instead of a single user with a list of passwords, Im using a single password with a list of users.
My issue is that no matter how I have approached this, the script hangs or stops at the ""Password: "" prompt. I have tried multiple methods, from using os.system and echoing the password in, passing it as a variable, and using the pexpect module. Nothing seems to be working.
When I Google it, all of the recommendations point to using sudo, which in this scenario, isnt a valid option as the user I have access to, doesnt have sudo privileges. 
I am beyond desperate on this, just to finish the challenge. I have asked on reddit, in IRC and all of my programming wizard friends, and beyond echo ""password"" |sudo -S su, which cant work because the user is not in the sudoers file, I am coming up short.

I am using PyQt to write the GUI for this app, and it comes packaged with QtWebKit, which DOES handle javascript. I want to use QtWebKit to evaluate the javascript on the page that I am stuck on, and the easiest way of doing this would be to transfer my web session from mechanize over to QtWebKit.

When testing locally, I can use bitcoinrpc.connect_to_local), or even bitcoinrpc.connect_to_remote('account','password') and this works as well as long as the account and password match the values specified in my 'bitcoin.conf' file. I can then use the connection object to get values and do some tasks in my django site.
The third parameter in connect_to_local is default localhost. I was wondering: 
A) What to specify for this third parameter in order to connect from my webserver to the wallet stored on my home comp (is it my IP address?)
B) Because the wallet is on my PC and not some dedicated server, does that mean that my IP will change and I won't be able to access the wallet?
C) The connection string is in the django app - which is hosted on heroku. Heroku apps are launched by pushing with git but I believe it is to a private repository. Still, if anyone could see the first few lines of my 'view' they would have all they need to take my BTC (or, more accurately, mBTC). Anyone know how bad this is - or any ways to go about doing btc payments/movements in a more secure way.
Thanks a lot.","

69,"I'm writing python app which currently is being hosted on Heroku. It is in early development stage, so I'm using free account with one web dyno. Still, I want my heavier tasks to be done asynchronously so I'm using iron worker add-on. I have it all set up and it does the simplest jobs like sending emails or anything that doesn't require any data being sent back to the application. The question is: How do I send the worker output back to my application from the iron worker? Or even better, how do I notify my app that the worker is done with the job?
I looked at other iron solutions like cache and message queue, but the only thing I can find is that I can explicitly ask for the worker state. Obviously I don't want my web service to poll the worker because it kind of defeats the original purpose of moving the tasks to background. What am I missing here?","

What I though of so far:

provide a connection object in a Model's __init__(); this will work, by setting an instance variable and use it throughout the methods, but it will kind of break the API; users shouldn't always feed a connection object when they create a Model object;
create the connection object separately, store it somewhere (where?) and on Model's __init__() get the connection from where it has been stored and put it in an instance variable (this is what I thought to be the best approach, but have no idea of the best spot to store that connection object);
create a connection pool which will be fed with the connection object, then on Model's __init__() fetch the connection from the connection pool (how do I know which connection to fetch from the pool?).

The question is: In PyQt, how can I use a QDataStream to save QTreeWidgetItems to a file as native QT objects, and then read the file back to restore the tree structure exactly as it was saved?
Eric","  Thanks!
Here is the source code. (If you need to post your question I'm assuming you mean the official PyPy code.)

97,"I'm creating a Google App Engine application (python) and I'm learning about the general framework. I've been looking at the tutorial and documentation for the NDB datastore, and I'm having some difficulty wrapping my head around the concepts. I have a large background with SQL databases and I've never worked with any other type of data storage system, so I'm thinking that's where I'm running into trouble.
My current understanding is this: The NDB datastore is a collection of entities (analogous to DB records) that have properties (analogous to DB fields/columns). Entities are created using a Model (analogous to a DB schema). Every entity has a key that is generated for it when it is stored. This is where I run into trouble because these keys do not seem to have an analogy to anything in SQL DB concepts. They seem similar to primary keys for tables, but those are more tightly bound to records, and in fact are fields themselves. These NDB keys are not properties of entities, but are considered separate objects from entities. If an entity is stored in the datastore, you can retrieve that entity using its key. 
One of my big questions is where do you get the keys for this? Some of the documentation I saw showed examples in which keys were simply created. I don't understand this. It seemed that when entities are stored, the put() method returns a key that can be used later. So how can you just create keys and define ids if the original keys are generated by the datastore?
Another thing that I seem to be struggling with is the concept of ancestry with keys. You can define parent keys of whatever kind you want. Is there a predefined schema for this? For example, if I had a model subclass called 'Person', and I created a key of kind 'Person', can I use that key as a parent of any other type? Like if I wanted a 'Shoe' key to be a child of a 'Person' key, could I also then declare a 'Car' key to be a child of that same 'Person' key? Or will I be unable to after adding the 'Shoe' key?
I'd really just like a simple explanation of the NDB datastore and its API for someone coming from a primarily SQL background."," 

 As a final note, don`t forget that some types of database exist as collections rather than as primary columns for database queries.

Can it be done with tkinter at all? I'm not familiar with qt but I'll try to use it if the feature can be achieved with it.","  http://www.qt.iott.org/apps/view experiences
